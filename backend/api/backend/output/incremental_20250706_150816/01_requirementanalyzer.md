*   **LLM-Guided Content Creation:** The generation of each report section shall be primarily guided by Large Language Models (LLMs), leveraging their capabilities for synthesis, summarization, and content creation from diverse data inputs.
*   **User Input for Report Customization:** The framework shall allow users to specify research requirements, such as industry, specific competitors, or market segments, to generate focused and relevant reports. (Referencing `test_ppt.pptx` slide 2, "Custom Report Generation").
*   **Data Aggregation:** The framework shall be capable of aggregating data from various sources including industry news, company reports, SEC filings, market databases, research papers, primary research sources (e.g., Nielsen, Kantar), and real-time social media signals. (Referencing `test_ppt.pptx` slide 2, "Data Collection").
*   **Continuous Updates:** The system shall support continuous monitoring of market developments and automatically incorporate new data to keep reports current with real-time industry changes. (Referencing `test_ppt.pptx` slide 2, "Continuous Updates").
*   **Personalization (Future Consideration):** The framework *could* be extended to derive customer-specific action items based on customer interactions, sales trends, and marketing outreach. (Referencing `test_ppt.pptx` slide 2, "Personalisation").

### Non-Functional Requirements
*   **Performance Requirements:**
    *   The framework should generate comprehensive reports within a reasonable timeframe, though specific latency targets are not yet defined.
    *   Processing of large datasets and LLM inferences should be optimized for efficiency.
*   **Security Requirements:**
    *   Data processed by the framework, especially sensitive market intelligence, must be secured against unauthorized access and breaches.
    *   LLM API keys and credentials must be handled securely.
    *   Input data should be validated to prevent injection attacks or malicious inputs.
*   **Scalability Requirements:**
    *   The framework must be designed to scale horizontally to accommodate increased data volume, more complex report requests, and a growing number of concurrent users.
    *   The architecture should support distributed processing for data aggregation and LLM inference.
*   **Usability Requirements:**
    *   **Modularity:** The framework shall be designed with clear, independent modules for each functional component (e.g., data collection, analysis, report generation, output formatting) to facilitate maintenance and upgrades.
    *   **Documentation:** Comprehensive and detailed documentation for implementation, API usage, and future extensions shall be provided, adhering to best practices like PEP 257 for docstrings and including a `README.md` file.
    *   **Maintainability:** The codebase should follow good coding practices (e.g., PEP 8 guidelines from `coding_standards.docx`) to ensure readability, consistency, and ease of debugging.

### Technical Constraints
*   **LLM Integration:** The core intelligence relies on integration with Large Language Models. Specific LLM providers (e.g., Google, OpenAI) or an on-premise LLM solution will need to be decided.
*   **Data Integration:** The framework must integrate with various external data sources, requiring robust data connectors and parsing capabilities for structured and unstructured data.
*   **Python Ecosystem:** Given the `coding_standards.docx` focus on Python, it's implied that Python will be the primary programming language for the framework.
*   **Version Control:** The project shall use a version control system (e.g., Git) for collaborative development and change tracking.
*   **Virtual Environments:** Development and deployment must utilize virtual environments to manage project dependencies and prevent conflicts.
*   **Output Format:** The final report output format (e.g., PDF, HTML, Markdown, Word document) needs to be determined based on user consumption preferences. Initially, a structured text output is assumed.

### Assumptions and Clarifications
*   **Definition of "Gartner Style":** It is assumed that "Gartner style" implies a high level of analytical rigor, data-driven insights, forward-looking predictions, and a clear, professional presentation of market intelligence. The specific visual and branding elements of Gartner reports are not within the scope unless explicitly requested.
*   **Data Access and Licensing:** It is assumed that necessary licenses or permissions will be obtained for accessing proprietary data sources (e.g., Nielsen, Kantar, SEC filings, market databases) required for comprehensive market research.
*   **LLM Capabilities:** It is assumed that the chosen LLMs are sufficiently capable of performing complex analysis, synthesis, summarization, and generating coherent and accurate content for market research reports.
*   **User Interface for Customization:** Clarification is needed on how users will interact with the framework to specify report requirements (e.g., web interface, API, command-line tool).
*   **Report Output Format:** Clarification is needed on the desired final output format for the generated market research reports (e.g., plain text, Markdown, PDF, Microsoft Word, web-based).
*   **Human Oversight/Review:** It is assumed that a human review process will be in place to validate LLM-generated content for accuracy, bias, and adherence to specific nuances, especially given the potential for LLM hallucinations.

### Risk Assessment
*   **Technical Risks:**
    *   **LLM Hallucinations and Inaccuracy:** LLMs can generate factually incorrect or nonsensical information.
        *   *Mitigation Strategy:* Implement robust fact-checking mechanisms, cross-referencing with reliable data sources, and incorporate a human-in-the-loop review process before report finalization. Utilize Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to ground LLM responses in verified data.
    *   **Data Quality and Availability:** Poor quality, incomplete, or unavailable data from integrated sources will severely impact the accuracy and depth of the generated reports.
        *   *Mitigation Strategy:* Implement strong data validation and cleansing routines. Establish clear data source prioritization and fallback mechanisms. Diversify data sources to minimize reliance on a single point of failure.
    *   **LLM Integration Complexity and Cost:** Integrating with various LLM APIs and managing their usage costs can be complex and expensive, especially at scale.
        *   *Mitigation Strategy:* Design a flexible LLM abstraction layer to allow swapping providers. Implement token usage monitoring and cost optimization strategies. Explore fine-tuning smaller, more specialized models for specific tasks if cost becomes prohibitive.
    *   **Scalability Challenges:** Ensuring the data pipeline, LLM inference, and report generation can scale efficiently to meet demand.
        *   *Mitigation Strategy:* Adopt a microservices or modular architecture. Utilize cloud-native services for scalable data processing (e.g., serverless functions, managed databases). Implement caching mechanisms where appropriate.
    *   **Data Privacy and Compliance:** Handling sensitive or proprietary market data requires adherence to data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
        *   *Mitigation Strategy:* Implement data anonymization/pseudonymization techniques where possible. Ensure all data storage and processing comply with relevant regulations. Conduct regular security audits.
*   **Project Risks:**
    *   **Scope Creep:** The "Gartner-style" nature can lead to an ever-expanding definition of features.
        *   *Mitigation Strategy:* Clearly define the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and phase subsequent features. Maintain strict change control.
    *   **Evolving LLM Technology:** Rapid advancements in LLM technology might necessitate frequent updates to the framework.
        *   *Mitigation Strategy:* Design the LLM integration layer for flexibility and easy adaptation to new models or APIs. Stay updated with LLM research and industry trends.
