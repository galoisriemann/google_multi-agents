## System Architecture Design

### High-Level Architecture

The system will adopt a **Layered Architecture** with principles of **Clean Architecture** to ensure separation of concerns, testability, and maintainability, even for a "simple" initial requirement. This approach allows for easy evolution and scaling by swapping components without impacting core business logic.

*   **Overall System Design:** A single, self-contained application service primarily focused on text content management.
*   **Architecture Pattern:** Layered Architecture adhering to Clean Architecture principles.

**Core Layers:**
1.  **Presentation/API Layer:** Handles external requests (e.g., HTTP), translates them into application commands, and returns responses. It should be thin, focusing on communication protocols.
2.  **Application Layer (Use Cases):** Contains the application-specific business rules. It orchestrates the flow of data to and from the domain entities and delegates persistence operations to the infrastructure layer. It defines *what* the application does.
3.  **Domain Layer (Entities & Business Rules):** Encapsulates the core business logic and entities. It defines *the rules of the business*. This layer is completely independent of external concerns like databases or UI.
4.  **Infrastructure Layer:** Provides implementations for interfaces defined in the Application/Domain layers. This includes data persistence (e.g., file system, database), external service integrations, and other technical details.

**Visual Representation (Conceptual):**

```

          | Requests / Responses

          | Data / Operations
          V
+---------------------+
| Domain Layer        |
| (Entities, Core Logic)|
+---------------------+
          | Interfaces (Ports)
          V
+---------------------+
| Infrastructure Layer|
| (Repositories, DBs, |
|  File System, External Services)
+---------------------+
```

### Component Design

**Core Components and Responsibilities:**

1.  **`main.py` (Entry Point):**
    *   Initializes the FastAPI application.
    *   Configures dependency injection.
    *   Registers API routes.

2.  **Presentation/API Layer (e.g., `app/api/`):**
    *   **`text_controller.py`:**
        *   **Responsibility:** Exposes RESTful API endpoints for text content operations (e.g., `/text/`, `/text/{id}`).
        *   **Interface:** HTTP endpoints.
        *   **Contracts:** Defines request/response models using Pydantic for data validation and serialization.
        *   **Interaction:** Receives HTTP requests, calls methods on `TextService` (Application Layer), and returns HTTP responses.

3.  **Application Layer (e.g., `app/application/`):**
    *   **`text_service.py`:**
        *   **Responsibility:** Orchestrates application-specific use cases for text content. Contains the "what" of the application's behavior.
        *   **Interface:** Methods like `create_text_content(content: str) -> Text`, `get_text_content(text_id: str) -> Text`.
        *   **Contracts:** Input/Output DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) or directly using Domain Entities.
        *   **Interaction:** Calls methods on `ITextRepository` (Domain Layer interface) to perform persistence operations, and interacts with `Text` (Domain Entity).
        *   **Dependencies:** Injects `ITextRepository`.

4.  **Domain Layer (e.g., `app/domain/`):**
    *   **`text.py`:**
        *   **Responsibility:** Represents the `Text` entity with its attributes (e.g., `id`, `content`, `created_at`, `updated_at`) and any core business rules related to text content (e.g., validation rules for content length, immutability of certain fields).
        *   **Interface:** Properties and methods defined on the `Text` class.
    *   **`interfaces.py`:**
        *   **`ITextRepository` (Interface/Abstract Base Class):**
            *   **Responsibility:** Defines the contract for data persistence operations for `Text` entities. This is a "port" in Clean Architecture.
            *   **Interface:** Abstract methods like `save(text: Text) -> Text`, `find_by_id(text_id: str) -> Optional[Text]`.
            *   **Contracts:** Operates on `Text` domain entities.

5.  **Infrastructure Layer (e.g., `app/infrastructure/`):**
    *   **`file_text_repository.py`:**
        *   **Responsibility:** Implements the `ITextRepository` interface using the file system as a storage mechanism.
        *   **Interaction:** Reads from and writes to specific files based on `Text` IDs.
        *   **Data Flow:** Transforms `Text` entities to file content (e.g., JSON, plain text) and vice-versa. Handles file I/O operations and error handling specific to file system access.
    *   **`config.py`:**
        *   **Responsibility:** Manages application configurations (e.g., storage paths).
    *   **`dependencies.py`:**
        *   **Responsibility:** Manages dependency injection, providing concrete implementations (e.g., `FileTextRepository`) for interfaces (e.g., `ITextRepository`).

**Data Flow Between Components:**

1.  **API Request:** An HTTP request (e.g., `POST /text/` with content in body) arrives at `TextController`.
2.  **Controller to Service:** `TextController` validates the request body (using Pydantic model), extracts data, and calls the appropriate method on `TextService` (e.g., `text_service.create_text_content(content)`).
3.  **Service to Domain:** `TextService` creates a `Text` domain entity instance.
4.  **Service to Repository (Interface):** `TextService` calls a method on its injected `ITextRepository` instance (e.g., `text_repository.save(text)`).
5.  **Repository (Implementation) to Storage:** The concrete `FileTextRepository` implementation handles the actual file I/O operations (e.g., writing the `Text` content to a file on disk).
6.  **Repository to Service:** The `FileTextRepository` returns the persisted `Text` entity to `TextService`.
7.  **Service to Controller:** `TextService` returns the `Text` entity to `TextController`.
8.  **Controller to API Response:** `TextController` serializes the `Text` entity into an HTTP response (e.g., JSON) and sends it back to the client.

### Technology Stack

*   **Programming Language:** Python 3.9+ (as per requirements).
*   **Web Framework:**
    *   **FastAPI:** Chosen for its high performance, automatic data validation (via Pydantic), automatic API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger UI), and excellent support for type hinting, aligning with PEPs and modern Python best practices.
*   **Data Validation/Serialization:**
    *   **Pydantic:** Integrated with FastAPI for defining request/response models and ensuring data integrity.
*   **Dependency Injection:**
    *   FastAPI's built-in dependency injection system will be leveraged.
*   **Databases and Storage Solutions:**
    *   **Initial:** File System (for "simple text content" as indicated by `project_requirements.txt`). Text content will be stored in designated files, with filenames potentially mapping to IDs.
    *   **Future/Scalability Option:** For more complex data management or higher volume, a lightweight NoSQL document database (e.g., MongoDB, TinyDB for local development/simple cases) or a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy) could be easily swapped in by creating new `ITextRepository` implementations.
*   **Testing Frameworks:**
    *   **Pytest:** For unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.
    *   **HTTPX:** For testing FastAPI endpoints.
*   **Code Quality & Linters:**
    *   **Black:** Opinionated code formatter (auto-fixes PEP 8).
    *   **Flake8:** Linter to enforce coding style and detect errors.
    *   **MyPy:** Static type checker to enforce PEP 484 type hinting.
    *   **Pylint:** Comprehensive code analysis tool.
*   **Documentation:**
    *   **FastAPI's auto-generated OpenAPI/Swagger UI:** For API documentation.
    *   **Sphinx:** For comprehensive project documentation (e.g., developer guides, architecture docs).
    *   **PEP 257:** Adherence to docstring conventions for internal code documentation.
*   **Version Control:**
    *   **Git:** As mandated.
*   **Dependency Management:**
    *   **`venv` (Python Virtual Environments):** As mandated, with `requirements.txt` for explicit dependency listing.
*   **Infrastructure and Deployment Considerations:**
    *   **Docker:** For containerizing the application, ensuring consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
    *   **Cloud Platform (Optional for simple cases):** Could be deployed on platforms like AWS ECS/EKS, Google Cloud Run/GKE, or Azure Container Apps for scalability and managed services.
    *   **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions or GitLab CI/CD for automated testing, linting, and deployment.

### Design Patterns

*   **Architectural Patterns:**
    *   **Layered Architecture:** Clear separation into Presentation, Application, Domain, and Infrastructure layers.
    *   **Clean Architecture (Ports and Adapters):** Emphasizes dependency inversion, ensuring the core domain logic is independent of external frameworks or databases. `ITextRepository` serves as a "port," and `FileTextRepository` is an "adapter."
*   **Design Patterns for Implementation:**
    *   **Repository Pattern:** Abstracts the data access layer, allowing the Application layer to interact with data stores through a consistent interface (`ITextRepository`).
    *   **Dependency Injection:** Manages the creation and provision of dependencies (e.g., injecting `ITextRepository` concrete implementation into `TextService`). FastAPI's dependency injection system simplifies this.
    *   **Factory Pattern (Implicit):** When choosing between different repository implementations (e.g., `FileTextRepository` vs. `DatabaseTextRepository`), a factory or configuration-driven approach can select the appropriate one.
    *   **DTO (Data Transfer Object):** Pydantic models serve as DTOs for data ingress/egress in the API layer, separating external data representation from internal domain entities.
    *   **Strategy Pattern (Potential):** If different "analysis" strategies for text are introduced later, they could be encapsulated as strategies.

### Quality Attributes

*   **Scalability:**
    *   **Stateless Design:** The API service will be stateless, allowing for easy horizontal scaling by running multiple instances behind a load balancer.
    *   **Component Modularity:** The layered architecture and Repository pattern allow for easy swapping of the persistence layer (e.g., from file system to a distributed database like Cassandra or a managed service like DynamoDB) without changing core business logic.
    *   **Containerization:** Docker allows for efficient resource utilization and orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes) for scaling out.
    *   **Python's GIL:** Acknowledged, but for I/O-bound "simple text content" operations, it's less of a bottleneck, and multiple Python processes can still scale horizontally.
*   **Security:**
    *   **Input Validation:** Pydantic models at the API layer provide automatic schema validation, preventing malformed requests.
    *   **Data Integrity:** Validation rules can be enforced in the Domain layer for `Text` entities. The chosen storage mechanism will ensure data is written and read correctly.
    *   **Access Control (Future):** Authentication (e.g., JWT) and Authorization (e.g., Role-Based Access Control) can be implemented as middlewares or FastAPI dependencies at the Presentation layer to protect endpoints.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Ensure the application has only the necessary file system permissions for its operations.
    *   **Error Handling:** Graceful error handling to prevent information leakage through detailed error messages.
*   **Performance Optimizations:**
    *   **Lightweight Framework:** FastAPI provides high performance due to its ASGI nature and Pydantic integration.
    *   **Efficient I/O:** For file-based storage, optimized Python I/O operations will be used.
    *   **Caching (Future):** For frequently accessed text content, in-memory caching (e.g., LRU cache) or a distributed cache (e.g., Redis) can be introduced at the Application layer.
    *   **Asynchronous Operations:** FastAPI supports `async`/`await` which can be leveraged if I/O operations become significant (e.g., large files, network calls to other services).
*   **Maintainability Features:**
    *   **Clean Architecture:** Clear separation of concerns, making code easier to understand, modify, and extend. Changes in one layer have minimal impact on others.
    *   **SOLID Principles:** Adherence to Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion principles.
    *   **Comprehensive Documentation:** Auto-generated API docs, PEP 257 compliant docstrings, and Sphinx for project-level documentation.
    *   **Strict Code Quality Standards:** Enforcement of PEP 8 (Black), type hinting (MyPy), and linting (Flake8, Pylint) ensures consistent, readable, and less error-prone code.
    *   **High Testability:** The modular design with clear interfaces (e.g., `ITextRepository`) makes unit testing components in isolation straightforward by mocking dependencies.
    *   **Virtual Environments:** Ensures project dependencies are isolated and reproducible, simplifying onboarding and deployment.
