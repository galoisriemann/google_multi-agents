It appears there might be a misunderstanding regarding the input for the system architecture design.

The "context" provided by `[RequirementAnalyzer]` is a "Simple Test Report" which summarizes the content of various test files (`test.xlsx`, `test_ppt.pptx`, `project_requirements.txt`). This report details the data found within those files (e.g., sheet names, slide content, file text).

However, this test report *does not contain any functional or non-functional requirements for a new software system* to be designed. My role as an Architectural Designer is to "Design overall system architecture... based on the analyzed requirements."

Since no system requirements have been provided, I am unable to create a meaningful system architecture design. The information about `test.xlsx`, `test_ppt.pptx`, and `project_requirements.txt` describes existing data/documents, not a system that needs to be built.

Please provide the actual system requirements (e.g., what the system should do, who its users are, its performance needs, security considerations, etc.) for the software system you wish me to design. Once those requirements are available, I can proceed with the architectural design.
