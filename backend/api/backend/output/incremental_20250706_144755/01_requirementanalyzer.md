### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance Requirements:**
    - The data collection and analysis processes should be efficient to minimize report generation time, especially for real-time updates.
    - LLM processing should be optimized for speed without compromising accuracy.
- **Security Requirements:**
    - Data collected and processed, especially sensitive market data or proprietary information, must be secured against unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.
    - Authentication and authorization mechanisms must be robust for accessing data sources and the framework itself.
    - Compliance with relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) must be ensured if personal or sensitive business data is processed.
- **Scalability Requirements:**
    - The framework must be scalable to handle increasing volumes of data from various sources.
    - It should support a growing number of simultaneous report generation requests.
    - The underlying architecture should allow for horizontal scaling of computational resources (e.g., LLM inference, data processing).
- **Usability Requirements:**
    - The user interface or API for defining report parameters and initiating generation should be intuitive and user-friendly.
    - Reports should be generated in a clear, well-structured, and professional format, resembling Gartner's style.
    - The framework must adhere to good coding practices (e.g., PEP 8 for Python code layout, naming conventions, and general recommendations as per `coding_standards.docx`) for maintainability and collaboration.
    - Documentation must be comprehensive, clear, and easy to understand for developers and users.

### Technical Constraints
- **LLM Integration:** The framework's core relies on seamless integration with one or more Large Language Models (LLMs) via APIs.
- **Data Source Connectors:** The system requires robust connectors and APIs to aggregate data from a wide variety of structured and unstructured sources (e.g., web scraping for news/social media, database connectors, API integrations for market data providers, file parsing for SEC filings/reports).
- **Python-based Development (Preferred):** Given the reference to PEPs and Python coding standards in `coding_standards.docx`, Python is implicitly preferred for development, implying adherence to its best practices (e.g., virtual environments, specific naming conventions, docstring standards).
- **Version Control System:** The project must utilize a version control system, preferably Git, for collaborative development and change tracking.
- **Documentation Standards:** Documentation should follow established standards, potentially leveraging tools like Sphinx and Read The Docs for generating comprehensive project and code documentation, as suggested in `coding_standards.docx`.
- **Project Structure:** Adherence to a standardized project directory structure (e.g., `source`, `scripts`, `docs`, `tests`, `notebooks` as outlined in `coding_standards.docx`) for better organization and reproducibility.
- **Output Format:** Reports should be exportable in common professional formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX, interactive web dashboards) to facilitate distribution and presentation.

### Assumptions and Clarifications
- **LLM Capability:** It is assumed that the chosen LLMs are capable of performing complex analytical tasks, pattern recognition, synthesis, and nuanced text generation required for high-quality market research.
- **Data Access:** It is assumed that necessary APIs, licenses, or agreements for accessing premium market databases and primary research sources (e.g., Nielsen, Kantar) are in place or can be acquired.
- **"Gartner-style":** This implies not just a specific structure, but also a certain depth of analysis, visual presentation quality (though not explicitly requested, it's typical of such reports), and the ability to provide strategic, forward-looking insights. Clarification on specific formatting or design elements would be beneficial.
- **User Input for Personalization:** It is assumed that users will provide the necessary customer-specific data (interactions, sales trends, marketing outreach) for the personalization module. The format and method of this input need to be clarified.
- **Definition of "Real-time Social Media Signals":** Clarification is needed on the specific platforms, volume, and latency requirements for processing social media data.
- **Continuous Update Frequency:** The desired frequency for "continuous updates" (e.g., daily, hourly, real-time streaming) needs to be clarified as it impacts system design and cost.
- **User Interface Scope:** Clarification on whether a full-fledged web-based UI is expected for report customization and generation, or if command-line or API-based interaction is sufficient.

### Risk Assessment
- **LLM Hallucinations and Accuracy:**
    - **Risk:** LLMs can generate plausible but incorrect or fabricated information, leading to inaccurate market insights and poor business decisions.
    - **Mitigation:** Implement multi-source data validation, cross-referencing information, and human-in-the-loop review for critical findings. Develop confidence scores for LLM-generated insights. Use fine-tuning with ground truth data where possible.
- **Data Quality, Completeness, and Accessibility:**
    - **Risk:** Inaccurate, incomplete, or inaccessible data from various sources can compromise the quality and reliability of the generated reports.
    - **Mitigation:** Implement robust data validation and cleansing pipelines. Develop resilient data connectors with comprehensive error handling. Establish clear data governance policies and data freshness requirements.
- **Computational Cost and Latency of LLMs:**
    - **Risk:** Running complex analyses with powerful LLMs can be computationally intensive and incur high operational costs, potentially leading to slow report generation times.
    - **Mitigation:** Optimize LLM prompts, employ prompt engineering best practices, and leverage caching mechanisms for frequently requested data or insights. Consider using a mix of large foundational models for complex reasoning and smaller, specialized models for specific sub-tasks. Explore cost-effective LLM deployment strategies (e.g., cloud services, local models if feasible).
- **Maintaining "Gartner-style" Quality and Depth:**
    - **Risk:** The LLM might struggle to consistently produce reports with the analytical depth, strategic relevance, and presentation quality expected of a "Gartner-style" report.
    - **Mitigation:** Develop explicit evaluation rubrics and use expert human reviewers to assess report quality. Provide the LLM with comprehensive templates, style guides, and examples of high-quality Gartner reports. Implement iterative feedback loops to refine LLM performance.
- **Integration Complexities with Diverse Data Sources:**
    - **Risk:** Integrating with a wide array of external APIs, databases, and unstructured data sources can be technically challenging and prone to errors.
    - **Mitigation:** Prioritize integration with well-documented APIs. Develop a modular data ingestion layer with standardized data models. Implement robust error handling, retry mechanisms, and monitoring for all external data connections.
- **Security and Data Privacy Compliance:**
    - **Risk:** Handling sensitive market and potentially proprietary client data without adequate security measures could lead to data breaches or non-compliance with regulations.
    - **Mitigation:** Implement end-to-end encryption for data at rest and in transit. Enforce strict access controls and role-based permissions. Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing. Ensure compliance with all relevant data protection laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, etc.).
- **Scalability Bottlenecks:**
    - **Risk:** As the demand for reports or data volume grows, the system might encounter performance bottlenecks, impacting responsiveness and reliability.
    - **Mitigation:** Design the architecture for distributed processing and microservices. Leverage cloud-native scalable services (e.g., serverless functions, managed databases, message queues). Implement load balancing and auto-scaling where appropriate.
