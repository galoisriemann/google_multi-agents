                                   LLMGenerationError, etc., providing more detail.
        """
```

## Examples

### Generating a Market Research Report
To generate a report, instantiate the `ReportOrchestrator` and call its `generate_report` method with a `ReportRequest` object. The `generate_report` method is asynchronous, so it must be awaited within an `asyncio` event loop.

```python
import asyncio
from src.main import ReportOrchestrator
from src.modules.models import ReportRequest
from src.modules.config import Settings
from src.modules.utils import ReportGenerationError

async def main():
    settings = Settings()
    # Ensure LLM_API_KEY and other sensitive settings are loaded from .env or environment variables
    # settings.LLM_API_KEY = os.getenv("LLM_API_KEY", "your_default_key_if_needed") 
    # settings.SOCIAL_MEDIA_API_KEY = os.getenv("SOCIAL_MEDIA_API_KEY", "your_default_key_if_needed")

    orchestrator = ReportOrchestrator(settings)

    sample_request = ReportRequest(
        industry="Artificial Intelligence",
        competitors=["OpenAI", "Google", "Microsoft"],
        market_segments=["Generative AI", "Computer Vision", "Natural Language Processing"],
        time_period="2024-2030",
        key_metrics=["adoption rate", "funding trends", "patent filings"],
        custom_instructions="Focus on the impact of large language models on enterprise solutions."
    )

    try:
        print("Submitting report request...")
        report = await orchestrator.generate_report(sample_request)
        print("\n--- REPORT GENERATED SUCCESSFULLY ---")
        print(f"Report ID: {report['report_id']}")
        print("\n--- EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ---")
        print(report['executive_summary'])
        print("\n--- FULL REPORT PREVIEW (First 1000 chars) ---")
        print(report['full_report_content'][:1000] + "...")
        print("\n------------------------------------")
    except ReportGenerationError as e:
        print(f"Report generation failed: {e}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```
```

### User Guide
```markdown
# User Guide

This guide provides instructions on how to use the LLM-Guided Market Research Report Generation Framework to generate comprehensive market intelligence reports.

## Getting Started

### 1. Define Your Research Scope
To generate a report, you need to provide a `ReportRequest` specifying your research needs. This is the primary input to the system. The clearer and more specific your request, the more targeted and relevant the generated report will be.

**Key parameters for `ReportRequest`:**
*   `industry` (Required): The primary industry or market you want to analyze (e.g., "Cloud Computing", "Fintech", "Renewable Energy").
*   `competitors` (Optional): A list of specific companies or organizations you want to include in the competitive landscape analysis (e.g., `["AWS", "Azure", "Google Cloud"]`).
*   `market_segments` (Optional): Specific sub-segments within the industry to focus on (e.g., `["IaaS", "PaaS", "SaaS Infrastructure"]`).
*   `time_period` (Optional, default: "current"): The time frame for the analysis (e.g., "2023-2028", "next 5 years", "current").
*   `key_metrics` (Optional): Specific metrics or data points you are interested in (e.g., `["market share", "growth rate", "innovation index", "ROI"]`).
*   `custom_instructions` (Optional): Any additional instructions or specific areas of focus for the LLM to consider during content generation. This is useful for highly niche or sensitive topics.

### 2. Submitting a Request
Currently, interaction is demonstrated via the `src/main.py` script, which simulates an API call. In a deployed system, you would typically interact with a RESTful API endpoint.

**Example (as seen in `src/main.py`):**
```python
from src.modules.models import ReportRequest

sample_request = ReportRequest(
    industry="Cloud Computing",
    competitors=["AWS", "Azure", "Google Cloud"],
    market_segments=["IaaS", "PaaS", "SaaS Infrastructure"],
    time_period="2023-2028",
    key_metrics=["market share", "growth rate", "innovation index"]
)
# In a real API, you would send this as a JSON payload to an endpoint.
# E.g., via a POST request to `/generate_report`
# response = requests.post("http://api.yourdomain.com/generate_report", json=sample_request.model_dump())
```

### 3. Interpreting the Report
The generated report will be returned in a structured format (e.g., Markdown text, which can be converted to PDF/DOCX in a full implementation). It includes:
*   **Report ID:** A unique identifier for your generated report.
*   **Executive Summary:** A high-level overview of the most critical findings, insights, and recommendations. This is designed for quick consumption by executives.
*   **Full Report Content:** The detailed report organized into sections:
    *   Industry Analysis
    *   Competitive Landscape
    *   Market Trends and Future Predictions
    *   Technology Adoption Analysis and Recommendations
    *   Strategic Insights and Actionable Recommendations

## Advanced Usage

### Customizing Report Focus
Leverage the `custom_instructions` field in `ReportRequest` to steer the LLM's focus. For example:
*   "Analyze the impact of quantum computing on the financial services sector, specifically focusing on fraud detection."
*   "Provide recommendations for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to adopt AI solutions, considering budget constraints."

### Continuous Market Monitoring (Conceptual)
The framework is designed with an event-driven architecture that *can* support continuous market monitoring. In a fully implemented version, this would mean:
*   Regularly scheduled data ingestion tasks (e.g., daily news scrapes, hourly API calls).
*   Automated re-generation or updating of reports when significant new data or trends are identified.
*   Alerting mechanisms to notify users of critical market shifts.

## Best Practices

*   **Be Specific in Requests:** The more precise your `industry`, `competitors`, and `market_segments` are, the better the LLM can narrow its focus and provide relevant content.
*   **Iterate on `custom_instructions`:** For complex or nuanced topics, you may need to try different `custom_instructions` to achieve the desired depth and perspective in your report.
*   **Review LLM Outputs Critically:** While the framework employs RAG to reduce hallucinations, always critically review the generated content for factual accuracy, bias, and relevance. LLMs are powerful tools, but human oversight remains crucial for high-stakes decisions.
*   **Consider Data Freshness:** Understand the data sources feeding the system. If real-time insights are paramount, ensure the underlying data ingestion mechanisms are configured for high-frequency updates.

## Troubleshooting

### General Issues
*   **"Failed to generate report"**: This is a catch-all error indicating a failure in one of the report generation stages. Check the detailed logs for specific error messages.
    *   `DataIngestionError`: Problem with collecting raw data. Check internet connectivity, API keys, or if the requested data is available.
    *   `DataProcessingError`: Issue during data cleansing, transformation, or embedding generation. This could be due to malformed raw data or internal processing logic.
    *   `MarketAnalysisError`: Failure during the structured market analysis. This might be due to unexpected data formats or issues with analytical models.
    *   `LLMGenerationError`: The Large Language Model failed to generate content. This can happen due to:
        *   **API Key Issues:** Ensure `LLM_API_KEY` in your `.env` file is correct and active.
        *   **Rate Limits:** The LLM provider might be imposing rate limits. Wait a bit and retry.
        *   **Context Window Limits:** Very broad or extensive requests might exceed the LLM's context window. Try to narrow down your `custom_instructions` or `time_period`.
        *   **Unexpected LLM Output:** The LLM might return an unparseable response.
    *   `ReportAssemblyError`: Problem combining the generated sections into a final report. This might indicate an issue with the LLM output format not matching the report template.

### Log Analysis
The framework uses standard Python logging. To troubleshoot, review the console output for `WARNING` and `ERROR` level messages. Increasing the logging level to `DEBUG` in `src/modules/utils.py` can provide more verbose insights into the internal workings.

```python
# In src/modules/utils.py, change:
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO, # Change to logging.DEBUG for verbose output
    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
    handlers=[
        logging.StreamHandler(sys.stdout)
    ]
)
```

For production deployments, ensure logs are collected by a centralized logging system (e.g., ELK Stack, Splunk, cloud-native log management) for easier analysis and alerting.
```

9.  **Message Broker (`src/modules/message_broker.py` - Simulated):** Facilitates asynchronous communication and decoupling between services using an event-driven pattern (conceptually Apache Kafka, AWS SQS/SNS).

**Design Principles:**
*   **Asynchronous First:** All inter-service communications and I/O-bound operations are designed with `asyncio` to ensure high throughput and low latency.
*   **Modularity:** Each service is loosely coupled and adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle, facilitating independent development, testing, and deployment.
*   **Pydantic Models:** Used extensively for data validation and clear data contract definition between services.
*   **Error Handling:** Granular custom exception types (`src/modules/utils.py`) are used for specific failure scenarios, enabling robust error logging and potential retry mechanisms.

## Deployment Guide

Deploying the LLM-Guided Market Research Report Generation Framework as a production system involves transitioning from simulated components to real, scalable cloud services.

1.  **Containerization (Docker):**
    *   Create `Dockerfile`s for each microservice (`data_ingestion_service`, `data_processing_service`, etc.) to package them into isolated containers.
    *   This ensures portability and consistent environments.

2.  **Orchestration (Kubernetes / ECS / Azure Container Apps):**
    *   Deploy your containerized microservices to a container orchestration platform (e.g., Kubernetes (AWS EKS, Azure AKS, GCP GKE), AWS ECS, Azure Container Apps).
    *   Configure horizontal pod autoscaling to dynamically scale service instances based on load.

3.  **Real Message Broker:**
    *   Replace the in-memory `MessageBroker` with a managed cloud message queue service (e.g., AWS SQS/SNS, Azure Service Bus, GCP Pub/Sub, or a managed Kafka service like Confluent Cloud).
    *   Configure topics/queues for inter-service communication.
    *   Implement asynchronous message consumption in each service (e.g., using `aio_pika`, `aiokafka`, or cloud-specific SDKs).

4.  **Persistent Data Stores:**
    *   **Data Lake:** Use cloud object storage (AWS S3, Azure Data Lake Storage, GCP Cloud Storage).
    *   **Data Warehouse/Metadata DB:** Deploy a managed relational database (e.g., AWS RDS PostgreSQL, Azure Database for PostgreSQL, GCP Cloud SQL). Configure backups, replication, and performance tuning.
    *   **Vector Database:** Integrate with a specialized vector database service (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate Cloud) or a PostgreSQL instance with `pgvector` for vector embeddings.
    *   **Cache Store:** Use a managed in-memory cache service (e.g., AWS ElastiCache for Redis, Azure Cache for Redis, GCP Memorystore for Redis).

5.  **LLM Integration:**
    *   Integrate with actual LLM APIs (e.g., OpenAI API, Anthropic API, Google Gemini API) using their official Python SDKs.
    *   Implement robust retry mechanisms and circuit breakers for LLM API calls to handle transient errors and rate limits.
    *   Monitor token usage and costs.

6.  **Secrets Management:**
    *   Store all API keys, database credentials, and other sensitive information in a dedicated secrets manager (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault, Google Secret Manager).
    *   Configure your deployment environment to securely inject these secrets into your application containers at runtime.

7.  **CI/CD Pipeline:**
    *   Set up a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins).
    *   Automate testing, container image building, and deployment to your chosen cloud environment.

8.  **Monitoring and Logging:**
    *   Implement centralized logging (e.g., ELK Stack, Splunk, cloud-native logging services like AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, GCP Operations Suite).
    *   Set up comprehensive application performance monitoring (APM) and alerting (e.g., Prometheus/Grafana, Datadog) to track service health, performance metrics, and potential issues.
    *   Implement distributed tracing (e.g., OpenTelemetry) to gain visibility into requests flowing across microservices.

9.  **Network Security:**
    *   Deploy services within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) or similar isolated network.
    *   Configure strict security groups, network ACLs, and firewalls to control inbound and outbound traffic.
    *   Enforce TLS/SSL for all inter-service communication and external API endpoints.

### Quality and Security Notes
```markdown
# Quality and Security Report

This report summarizes the code quality, security posture, and performance characteristics of the LLM-Guided Market Research Report Generation Framework, highlighting known limitations and recommendations for production deployment.

## Code Quality Summary

**Strengths:**
*   **Modular & Asynchronous Architecture:** The refactored code effectively implements a microservices-oriented, event-driven architecture using `asyncio`, promoting scalability, maintainability, and responsiveness.
*   **Clear Data Models:** Extensive use of `Pydantic` models ensures strong typing, data validation, and improves overall code readability and consistency.
*   **Enhanced Error Handling:** Introduction of granular custom exceptions and specific `try-except` blocks allows for better error identification, logging, and more robust handling.
*   **Comprehensive Documentation & Setup:** Module-level docstrings, detailed method docstrings, and clear installation/usage instructions significantly aid in understanding and operating the codebase.
*   **Logging Implementation:** Consistent and contextual logging across modules is vital for monitoring and debugging.
*   **Testing Foundation:** The updated unit tests leverage `unittest.IsolatedAsyncioTestCase` and `AsyncMock` to effectively test asynchronous components, providing a solid base for quality assurance.

**Areas for Improvement (from a production readiness standpoint):**
*   **Real Asynchronous Processing:** While `async/await` are used, the in-memory `MessageBroker` and direct `await` calls in the orchestrator still simulate the full asynchronous decoupling that a real message queue (like Kafka) would provide.
*   **LLM Orchestration Realism:** The dummy LLM calls and simplified RAG (embedding generation, retrieval) oversimplify the complexities of real LLM interactions (rate limits, token management, cost, advanced prompt engineering, robust RAG pipelines).
*   **Data Store Simulation:** The in-memory data stores lack persistence, concurrency handling, and real database performance characteristics.

## Security Assessment

**Critical Issues (Currently Simulated/Missing Implementations):**
*   **Hardcoded Sensitive Information:** Placeholder API keys and database URLs in `config.py` require replacement with environment variables or, ideally, a secure secrets manager (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) in production.
*   **Lack of Robust Data Security for Data Stores:** The in-memory data stores currently offer no persistence, access control, or encryption at rest/in transit. This is a severe vulnerability in a multi-user or networked environment.
*   **LLM Prompt Injection and Data Leakage:** While conceptual mitigation is in place, the framework currently lacks robust input sanitization and output validation for LLM interactions to prevent prompt injection attacks or unintended data exposure (e.g., PII being sent to external LLMs).
*   **Insecure Inter-Service Communication:** The simulated `MessageBroker` lacks authentication, authorization, and encryption for messages, which are critical for protecting data in transit in a microservices environment.
*   **Insufficient Data Cleansing and Sanitization:** The data processing service performs basic cleansing. In a real system, more advanced sanitization for malicious scripts or PII is required.
*   **Potential for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Report Generation:** If reports are rendered in a web browser, the current string concatenation for report content could be vulnerable to XSS without proper output encoding/escaping.

**Recommendations:**
1.  **Implement Robust Secrets Management:** Transition all sensitive credentials to secure environment variables and a secrets management solution.
2.  **Adopt Production-Grade Data Stores:** Replace all in-memory data stores with secure, persistent, and scalable solutions (e.g., managed databases with encryption and RBAC).
3.  **Fortify LLM Interactions:** Implement comprehensive input sanitization for prompts, strict output validation and moderation, and PII anonymization before sending data to LLMs. Leverage frameworks like Guardrails AI or LangChain for this.
4.  **Secure Inter-Service Communication:** Utilize a production-ready message broker configured with TLS for encryption in transit and strong access controls.
5.  **Implement Comprehensive Data Sanitization:** Enhance the data processing service with more advanced techniques for cleaning, validating, and anonymizing data.
6.  **Protect Report Output from XSS:** Ensure all dynamic content in reports is properly HTML-escaped if rendered in a web context, or use secure document generation libraries for other formats.
7.  **Enhance Logging, Monitoring, and Alerting:** Establish a centralized logging system, monitor for security-relevant events, and set up alerts for suspicious activities.

## Performance Characteristics

**Current Limitations (Due to Simulation):**
*   **In-Memory Data Stores:** The primary bottleneck. Data processing and storage are limited by available RAM, preventing handling of large data volumes and offering no persistence.
*   **Synchronous Orchestration (Conceptual):** While `async/await` is used, the orchestrator still conceptually steps through services sequentially for demonstration. A real asynchronous system would process stages in parallel more extensively via message queues.
*   **Dummy LLM Calls and RAG:** The mocked LLM responses and naive RAG implementation do not reflect the high latency and computational intensity of real LLM inference and efficient vector search.

**Optimization Opportunities (Future Implementations):**
*   **Replace In-Memory Data Stores:** Transition to persistent, high-performance databases (S3, PostgreSQL, Pinecone, Redis) for significant I/O and scalability improvements.
*   **True Asynchronous Processing:** Refactor the message broker and service consumers to truly operate asynchronously in separate processes/tasks via a real message queue. This enables maximum parallelization and responsiveness.
*   **Optimized LLM & RAG Integration:** Integrate real LLM APIs with asynchronous clients (`httpx`), implement efficient embedding models, and leverage vector database's optimized ANN search algorithms for low-latency RAG.
*   **Caching Strategy:** Implement comprehensive caching for LLM responses and frequently accessed data to reduce redundant computations and API calls.
*   **Resource Optimization:** Monitor CPU/memory usage, especially during data processing and embedding generation. Consider distributed processing frameworks for very large datasets if single-node performance is insufficient.

## Known Limitations

*   **Simulated External Services:** The current implementation uses in-memory simulations for all external dependencies: LLM APIs, data sources, databases (Data Lake, Data Warehouse, Vector Database, Cache, Metadata DB), and the message broker. This allows for quick setup and demonstration but means the system is not production-ready in terms of persistence, concurrency, scalability, security, or real-world performance.
*   **Limited Data Sources:** Data ingestion is currently mocked. Integration with diverse, real-world data sources (e.g., live news APIs, social media streams, proprietary market data platforms) requires significant development.
*   **Basic LLM Integration:** The LLM responses are hardcoded. A full implementation requires advanced prompt engineering, handling LLM specific nuances (context window, token limits, rate limits, cost), and robust response parsing.
*   **Simplified Report Formatting:** The "Gartner-style" formatting is currently basic Markdown. Production-grade reports would require dedicated document generation libraries (e.g., for PDF, DOCX) and sophisticated templating for charts and complex layouts.
*   **No User Interface:** The framework is currently backend-only. A user-friendly interface would be required for broader usability.

# Changelog

## Version History

### 1.0.0 - Initial Refactored Version (Current)
*   **Features:**
    *   Implemented core LLM-guided market research report generation framework.
    *   Modular microservices architecture with conceptual event-driven design.
    *   Asynchronous processing using Python's `asyncio` for improved concurrency.
    *   Structured data handling with Pydantic models.
    *   Conceptualized data ingestion, processing, market analysis, LLM orchestration (with RAG), and report generation services.
    *   Basic in-memory data store simulations.
    *   Granular custom error handling.
    *   Comprehensive logging.
    *   Initial suite of unit tests.

## Breaking Changes

*   **Asynchronous API:** All core service methods and the `ReportOrchestrator.generate_report` method are now `async` functions. Direct synchronous calls are no longer supported. The `main` execution block now requires `asyncio.run()`.
*   **Environment Variables for Secrets:** Sensitive configuration values (e.g., `LLM_API_KEY`, `SOCIAL_MEDIA_API_KEY`) are no longer hardcoded in `src/modules/config.py`. They *must* be provided via environment variables or a `.env` file.
*   **Custom Error Hierarchy:** The generic `CustomError` has been replaced by a more specific hierarchy of exceptions (e.g., `DataIngestionError`, `LLMGenerationError`, `ReportAssemblyError`), requiring updates to `try-except` blocks if you were catching the old `CustomError`.
*   **Test Runner Update:** Unit tests now use `unittest.IsolatedAsyncioTestCase` for proper asynchronous test execution.

## Migration Guides

To migrate an existing setup or implement this framework:

1.  **Update Python Environment:** Ensure you are running Python 3.7+ (preferably 3.9+) to leverage `async/await`.
2.  **Install/Update Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install pydantic pydantic-settings
    ```
3.  **Replace Source Code:** Overwrite your existing `src/` and `tests/` directories with the refactored code provided.
4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    *   Create or update your `.env` file in the project root.
    *   Define `LLM_API_KEY`, `SOCIAL_MEDIA_API_KEY`, and `DATABASE_URL` as required.
    *   **Example `.env`:**
        ```dotenv
        LLM_API_KEY="your_actual_llm_api_key"
        SOCIAL_MEDIA_API_KEY="your_actual_social_media_api_key"
        DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///./app.db"
        ```
5.  **Adjust Application Entry Point:**
    *   If you have a custom entry point, ensure it uses `asyncio.run()` to invoke the `ReportOrchestrator.generate_report` method.
    *   The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block in `src/main.py` serves as an example.
6.  **Update Test Files:**
    *   Ensure all your test classes inherit from `unittest.IsolatedAsyncioTestCase`.
    *   Update any mock objects to `unittest.mock.AsyncMock()` for asynchronous methods.
    *   Replace `assert_called_once_with` with `assert_awaited_once_with` and similar `assert_awaited` methods.
7.  **Transition to Real Components (Future):**
    *   This refactoring lays the groundwork for using real databases, message brokers, and LLM APIs. When moving to production, replace the simulated methods in `src/modules/data_stores.py`, `src/modules/message_broker.py`, and `src/modules/llm_orchestration_service.py` with actual client library calls (e.g., `aiopg` for PostgreSQL, `httpx` for external APIs, `aiokafka` for Kafka, etc.). This will involve adding new `pip` dependencies.
