*   **F9: Continuous Market Monitoring and Updates**: The framework shall continuously monitor market developments and automatically incorporate new data to keep reports current with real-time industry changes.

### Non-Functional Requirements
*   **Performance Requirements**:
    *   **NFR1.1**: The framework shall generate reports in a timely manner, ideally supporting near real-time updates for market developments.
    *   **NFR1.2**: The data processing and analysis components shall efficiently handle large volumes of structured and unstructured data.
*   **Security Requirements**:
    *   **NFR2.1**: Data privacy and confidentiality shall be maintained for all collected and processed market intelligence.
    *   **NFR2.2**: Secure access controls shall be implemented for the framework and generated reports.
*   **Scalability Requirements**:
    *   **NFR3.1**: The framework shall be modular, allowing for independent development, deployment, and scaling of its components.
    *   **NFR3.2**: The system architecture shall support horizontal scalability to accommodate increasing data volumes, concurrent users, and report generation requests.
*   **Usability Requirements**:
    *   **NFR4.1**: The user interface for specifying research requirements shall be intuitive and user-friendly.
    *   **NFR4.2**: The generated reports shall be clear, concise, well-structured, and easy to interpret for business users, adhering to a "Gartner-style" quality.
*   **Maintainability Requirements**:
    *   **NFR5.1**: The codebase shall adhere to Python coding best practices, including PEP 8 for style, PEP 20 for principles, and PEP 257 for docstring conventions, to ensure high readability and maintainability.
    *   **NFR5.2**: Comprehensive documentation (including module-level docs, docstrings for functions/classes, and a README) shall be provided to facilitate understanding and future development.
    *   **NFR5.3**: The project structure shall be organized logically (e.g., using `source`, `scripts`, `docs`, `tests` directories) to promote reproducibility and collaboration.

### Technical Constraints
*   **Technology Stack Preferences**:
    *   **TC1.1**: The core intelligence component will rely on a Large Language Model (LLM).
    *   **TC1.2**: Implementation will primarily use Python, following best practices outlined in the `coding_standards.docx` document (e.g., use of virtual environments, PEP compliance, type hints).
    *   **TC1.3**: Version control (e.g., Git) is mandatory for collaborative development and change tracking.
*   **Platform Constraints**:
    *   **TC2.1**: A cloud-native architecture is preferred to ensure scalability, access to LLM services, and efficient data processing capabilities.
*   **Integration Requirements**:
    *   **TC3.1**: The framework must integrate with various external data sources (APIs for market databases, social media, web scraping for news/reports).
    *   **TC3.2**: Potential integration with data visualization libraries or tools for enhanced report presentation.

### Assumptions and Clarifications
*   **Assumptions Made**:
    *   **A1**: Access to a robust and capable LLM (via API or hosted service) is available and financially viable.
    *   **A2**: The necessary data sources for comprehensive market intelligence can be accessed, whether through public APIs, purchased subscriptions, or web scraping, in compliance with terms of service.
    *   **A3**: The term "Gartner style" implies a focus on clear, data-driven analysis, strategic implications, and professional presentation.
    *   **A4**: The framework will focus on the generation and analysis layer, assuming mechanisms for raw data collection and storage are either pre-existing or can be integrated.
*   **Questions that Need Clarification**:
    *   **Q1**: What specific LLM model(s) are targeted for integration (e.g., proprietary, open-source, or a mix)? This impacts capabilities, fine-tuning potential, and cost.
    *   **Q2**: What are the specific data sources required, and what are the access methods (e.g., specific API keys, web scraping permissions)?
    *   **Q3**: What is the acceptable latency for "real-time" or "continuous updates" (e.g., hourly, daily, stream processing)?
    *   **Q4**: What are the required output formats for the generated reports (e.g., PDF, DOCX, interactive web dashboard, JSON)?
    *   **Q5**: What is the target audience for the framework's direct interaction (e.g., technical analysts, business users, executives), influencing the complexity of the input interface?
    *   **Q6**: What is the estimated budget for LLM API usage and data acquisition subscriptions?

### Risk Assessment
*   **Potential Technical Risks**:
    *   **R1: LLM Hallucination and Factual Inaccuracy**: LLMs can generate content that is plausible but factually incorrect, which is critical for market research.
        *   **Mitigation Strategy**: Implement a robust validation layer for LLM outputs, cross-referencing information with reliable data sources. Incorporate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ground LLM responses in verified, up-to-date data. Include human-in-the-loop review for critical sections.
    *   **R2: Data Quality, Availability, and Cost**: Relying on external and real-time data sources introduces risks related to data quality, consistency, and the cost of acquisition/access.
        *   **Mitigation Strategy**: Implement comprehensive data validation and cleansing pipelines. Diversify data sources to reduce single points of failure. Clearly define data acquisition strategies and budget.
    *   **R3: High Computational and Operational Costs**: Extensive LLM usage, especially for continuous monitoring and large-scale report generation, can incur significant operational costs.
        *   **Mitigation Strategy**: Optimize LLM API calls, explore fine-tuning smaller models for specific tasks, implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data or generated segments, and analyze cost-effective LLM providers.
    *   **R4: Scalability Bottlenecks**: Ensuring the framework can scale efficiently to meet increasing demands for data processing, analysis, and report generation.
        *   **Mitigation Strategy**: Design a loosely coupled, microservices-oriented architecture leveraging cloud-native services (e.g., serverless functions, managed databases, message queues). Implement robust load balancing and auto-scaling.
    *   **R5: Keeping Market Intelligence Current**: LLMs have knowledge cut-off dates, and market dynamics change rapidly, posing a challenge for providing current insights.
        *   **Mitigation Strategy**: Continuously feed real-time and updated data into the RAG system to ensure the LLM's context is current. Implement automated data refresh cycles.
    *   **R6: Integration Complexity with Diverse Data Sources**: Integrating with various APIs, databases, and unstructured data sources can be complex and prone to errors.
        *   **Mitigation Strategy**: Develop flexible and extensible data connectors. Utilize standardized data models where possible. Implement robust error handling, logging, and retry mechanisms for data ingestion pipelines.
