## System Architecture Design

### High-Level Architecture
The proposed system architecture is a **Microservices Architecture** with an **Event-Driven backbone**. This pattern is chosen for its inherent modularity, scalability, resilience, and ability to handle diverse data sources and asynchronous processing required for LLM interactions and continuous market monitoring. Each core capability of the framework (e.g., data ingestion, market analysis, LLM orchestration, report generation) is encapsulated as an independent service.

**Key Components and Interactions:**

1.  **User Interface (UI) / API Gateway**: The entry point for users and external systems.
2.  **Request Orchestrator Service**: Coordinates the overall report generation workflow.
3.  **Data Ingestion Service**: Responsible for aggregating and normalizing data from various sources.
4.  **Data Processing Service**: Cleanses, transforms, and prepares data for analysis and LLM consumption.
5.  **Market Analysis Service**: Performs traditional statistical and analytical tasks on structured data.
6.  **LLM Orchestration Service**: Manages interactions with Large Language Models, including prompt engineering and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
7.  **Report Generation Service**: Assembles and formats the final Gartner-style reports.
8.  **Data Stores**: A combination of Data Lake, Data Warehouse, Vector Database, Cache, and Metadata Database.
9.  **Message Broker**: Facilitates asynchronous communication and decoupling between services.

This architecture ensures independent development, deployment, and scaling of components, addressing scalability (NFR3.1, NFR3.2) and maintainability (NFR5.1).

*   **Version Control**: Git (TC1.3).

### Design Patterns

*   **Architectural Patterns**:
    *   **Microservices Architecture**: Breaks down the system into small, independent, loosely coupled services, enabling modularity, scalability, and independent deployment.
    *   **Event-Driven Architecture**: Uses a Message Broker for asynchronous communication, facilitating decoupling, resilience, and real-time data flow for continuous monitoring.
    *   **Clean Architecture (within services)**: Each microservice will adhere to Clean Architecture principles, separating domain logic from application and infrastructure concerns, promoting testability and maintainability (NFR5.1).
    *   **Repository Pattern**: Within each service, abstracts data access logic, making the service agnostic to the underlying data storage technology.
*   **Design Patterns for Implementation**:
    *   **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Crucial for grounding LLM responses with real-time and factual data retrieved from the Vector Database and Data Warehouse, mitigating hallucination (R1) and ensuring currency (R5).
    *   **Strategy Pattern**: To support different data source connectors, LLM providers, report output formats, or analysis algorithms. Allows flexible addition of new strategies without modifying core logic.
    *   **Observer Pattern**: For the continuous market monitoring (F9), where Data Ingestion Service acts as a subject publishing `DataIngested` events, and other services (Data Processing, LLM Orchestration) act as observers.
    *   **Factory Method / Abstract Factory**: For dynamic creation of data connectors, LLM clients, or report renderers based on configuration.
    *   **Circuit Breaker**: To prevent cascading failures when external services (e.g., LLM APIs, data source APIs) are unavailable or slow, enhancing system resilience.
    *   **Retry Pattern**: For handling transient failures in network calls or external service interactions, improving robustness.
    *   **Command Pattern**: For encapsulating requests as objects, allowing for parameterization of clients with different requests, queuing, or logging of requests. Useful in the Request Orchestrator.

### Quality Attributes

*   **Scalability (NFR3.1, NFR3.2, R4 Mitigation)**:
    *   **Microservices & Containerization**: Allows independent horizontal scaling of individual services (e.g., Data Ingestion service can scale independently of LLM Orchestration). Docker containers deployed on Kubernetes enable elastic scaling based on demand.
    *   **Asynchronous Communication**: Message brokers (Kafka/SQS) decouple producers from consumers, buffering spikes in load and enabling services to process data at their own pace.
    *   **Stateless Services**: Most services are designed to be stateless, simplifying horizontal scaling by adding more instances behind load balancers.
    *   **Cloud-Native Services**: Leveraging managed cloud services (S3, RDS, managed message brokers) provides built-in scalability and reduced operational overhead.
    *   **Elasticsearch (if used)**: Scalable search and analytics for logs and processed data.
*   **Security (NFR2.1, NFR2.2)**:
    *   **Data Encryption**: All data will be encrypted at rest (in S3, databases) and in transit (TLS/SSL for all inter-service and external communication).
    *   **Access Control**: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) will govern user access to the UI and specific report types. Internal service-to-service communication will use secure methods (e.g., mTLS).
    *   **Secrets Management**: API keys for LLMs and external data sources will be securely stored and managed using a dedicated secrets manager (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault).
    *   **Data Privacy**: Pseudonymization or anonymization of sensitive market intelligence data where applicable. Adherence to data governance policies.
    *   **Network Security**: Services deployed within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with granular security groups and network ACLs to restrict unauthorized access.
    *   **LLM Security**: Input/output sanitization to prevent prompt injection attacks and protect against data leakage through LLM interactions.
*   **Performance Optimizations (NFR1.1, NFR1.2, R3 Mitigation)**:
    *   **Asynchronous & Parallel Processing**: Data ingestion and processing pipelines will leverage message queues and parallel execution to handle large volumes of structured and unstructured data efficiently. LLM calls, being IO-bound, will also be asynchronous.
    *   **Caching**: Redis will cache frequently accessed data, LLM responses, or pre-computed analytical insights to reduce redundant computations, LLM API calls (cost reduction), and improve response times.
    *   **Optimized Data Storage**: Using specialized databases like Vector DB for semantic search (RAG) and columnar databases for analytical queries ensures efficient data retrieval.
    *   **LLM Optimization**: Strategic prompt engineering, contextual chunking, and selective use of LLM calls (e.g., fine-tuning smaller models for specific tasks) to reduce latency and operational costs.
*   **Maintainability Features (NFR5.1, NFR5.2, NFR5.3)**:
    *   **Modularity (Microservices)**: Small, independent services are easier to understand, develop, test, and deploy in isolation, reducing complexity and maintenance burden.
    *   **Clean Architecture**: Applying Clean Architecture principles within each service ensures clear separation of concerns, making the codebase highly testable and adaptable to changes.
    *   **Comprehensive Documentation**: Adherence to Python coding standards (PEP 8, PEP 20, PEP 257) for consistent code style and well-defined docstrings. Detailed architectural documentation, API specifications (e.g., OpenAPI), and a clear project README (NFR5.2, NFR5.3).
    *   **Automated Testing**: Robust suite of unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for all components to ensure code quality and prevent regressions during maintenance.
    *   **Observability**: Centralized logging, metrics collection (Prometheus), and distributed tracing (e.g., OpenTelemetry) will provide deep insights into system behavior, facilitating rapid debugging and performance tuning.
    *   **Idempotency**: Designing critical operations to be idempotent simplifies error handling and retry logic, contributing to system robustness.
