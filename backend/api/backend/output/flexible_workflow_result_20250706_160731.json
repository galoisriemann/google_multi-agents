It fetches relevant templates and data, formats the report, generates charts, and creates the final document. Publishes `ReportGeneratedEvent`.\n9.  **Report Storage & Notification:** `Report Storage Service` consumes `ReportGeneratedEvent`, stores the report file and its metadata. The `Request Management Service` is also notified to update the report status to \"Completed\" and potentially trigger a notification to the user.\n10. **Continuous Updates:** `Scheduling Service` periodically triggers `Data Ingestion` and potentially re-runs analysis/report generation based on configured schedules.\n\n### Technology Stack\n\n*   **Programming Languages:** Python (primary),

**Event-Driven Architecture:** Services communicate asynchronously via events, enabling loose coupling, scalability, and resilience.\n*   **Data Lakehouse:** Combines the flexibility of a data lake with the structure of a data warehouse, providing a single source of truth for raw and processed data.\n*   **Serverless (Optional for specific components):** For event-driven processing of data ingestion or minor utility functions (e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure Functions) to optimize cost and operational overhead for infrequent tasks.\n\n#### Design Patterns for Implementation\n\n*   **Repository Pattern:** Abstracts data access logic from business logic for easier testing and maintainability.\n*   **Service Layer Pattern:** Defines a clear boundary between the presentation layer (UI/API) and the business logic layer within each microservice.\n*   **Builder Pattern:** Used in `Report Generation Service` to construct complex report objects step-by-step.\n*   **Strategy Pattern:** For interchangeable algorithms, e.g., different analytical models in the `Analysis & Insights Engine` or different prompt engineering strategies in the `LLM Orchestration Service`.\n*   **Observer Pattern:** For continuous updates, allowing services to react to changes in data or external market events.\n*   **Circuit Breaker Pattern:** To prevent cascading failures when external APIs or dependent services are unavailable (e.g., in `Data Ingestion Services` when calling external APIs).\n*   **Command Pattern:** Encapsulating report generation requests as objects, allowing for queueing, logging, and undoable operations.\n*   **Decorator Pattern:** For adding functionality to LLM prompts or data transformation steps (e.g., adding security filters, performance logging).\n*   **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):** Potentially for `Request Management` and `Report Storage` services to optimize read and write operations if throughput demands become very high.\n*   **Saga Pattern:** To manage distributed transactions and maintain data consistency across multiple services for complex workflows like report generation.\n\n### Quality Attributes\n\n#### Scalability\n\n*   **Microservices:** Each service can be scaled independently based on its specific load requirements. Services can be deployed with multiple instances behind load balancers.\n*   **Containerization (Docker) & Orchestration (Kubernetes):** Enables horizontal scaling by automatically adding/removing container instances based on CPU, memory, or custom metrics.\n*   **Asynchronous Communication (Kafka):** Decouples services, allowing producers and consumers to operate at different paces and absorb bursts of activity.\n*   **Cloud-Native Services:** Leveraging managed cloud services (e.g., S3, RDS, EKS, Serverless Functions) provides inherent scalability and reduces operational burden.\n*   **Stateless Services:** Most services are designed to be stateless to facilitate easy horizontal scaling. State is externalized to databases or message queues.\n*   **Data Sharding/Partitioning:** For databases, data can be sharded or partitioned to distribute load and improve query performance.\n*   **LLM Scaling:** Use of managed LLM services (e.g., Azure OpenAI) or auto-scaling clusters for self-hosted models. Batching LLM requests where possible.\n\n#### Security Considerations\n\n*   **Authentication & Authorization:**\n    *   **API Gateway:** Enforces authentication (e.g., OAuth 2.0, JWT) and role-based access control (RBAC) for all incoming requests.\n    *   **Service-to-Service Communication:** Mutual TLS (mTLS) for secure communication between microservices within the cluster.\n    *   **Least Privilege:** Each service runs with the minimum necessary permissions to perform its function.\n*   **Data Encryption:**\n    *   **Data at Rest:** All data stored in databases, object storage, and disk volumes will be encrypted using industry-standard algorithms (e.g., AES-256).\n    *   **Data in Transit:** All network communication (internal and external) will use TLS/SSL.\n*   **Input Validation & Sanitization:** Strict validation of all inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., prompt injection for LLMs, SQL injection for databases).\n*   **Secrets Management:** Use dedicated secrets management services (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault) for API keys, database credentials, and other sensitive information.\n*   **LLM Safety & Guardrails:** Implement content moderation, output filtering, and prompt engineering best practices to mitigate risks of biased, toxic, or hallucinated LLM outputs. Human-in-the-loop validation for critical insights.\n*   **Regular Security Audits & Penetration Testing:** Periodically assess the system for vulnerabilities.\n*   **Compliance:** Design with data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA) in mind, especially concerning data retention and user consent.\n\n#### Performance Optimizations\n\n*   **Asynchronous Processing:** Long-running tasks (data ingestion, LLM inference, report generation) are handled asynchronously via message queues, ensuring the UI remains responsive.\n*   **Caching:** Implement caching at the API Gateway level and within services (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data or LLM responses.\n*   **Optimized Data Storage:** Choosing appropriate databases for different data types (e.g., vector DB for RAG, graph DB for relationships, columnar DB for analytics) optimizes query performance.\n*   **Parallel Processing:** `Data Ingestion` and `LLM Orchestration` can process multiple data sources or LLM sub-queries in parallel.\n*   **Efficient LLM Prompting:** Advanced prompt engineering, few-shot learning, and RAG techniques to reduce LLM token usage and improve inference time while maintaining accuracy.\n*   **Resource Allocation:** Dynamically adjust compute resources (CPU, GPU) for LLM-intensive tasks.\n*   **Batch Processing:** Grouping data for LLM inference or data transformations to reduce overhead.\n\n#### Maintainability Features\n\n*   **Modularity (Microservices):** Independent development, deployment, and testing of services simplify maintenance and reduce the impact of changes.\n*   **Clear Interfaces (APIs & Events):** Well-defined contracts between services reduce coupling and facilitate understanding. OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for REST APIs.\n*   **Comprehensive Documentation:**\n    *   **Architectural Documentation:** High-level design, component diagrams, data flow.\n    *   **Service-level Documentation:** Readme files for each microservice describing its purpose, APIs, environment variables, and deployment steps.\n    *   **Code Documentation:** Adherence to Python PEP 8, PEP 20, PEP 257 for clear, commented, and self-documenting code.\n    *   **API Documentation:** Automatically generated API documentation (e.g., Swagger UI) for public and internal APIs.\n*   **Automated Testing:** Extensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for all services to ensure reliability and facilitate safe refactoring.\n*   **CI/CD Pipelines:** Automate build, test, and deployment processes, ensuring consistent and reliable releases.\n*   **Observability:** Centralized logging, metrics, and tracing enable developers to quickly diagnose issues, understand system behavior, and monitor performance in production.\n*   **Code Quality Tools:** Integration of linters (flake8, pylint), formatters (black), and static analysis tools (mypy) to enforce coding standards.\n*   **Version Control:** Git for source code management, with clear branching and merging strategies.",
