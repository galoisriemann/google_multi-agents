## Installation
To set up and run the simulated AI-Driven Market Analysis System:

1.  **Clone the Repository (Simulated):**
    In a real scenario, you would clone the project from a version control system. For this documentation, assume the project structure is as described.

2.  **Navigate into the Project Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd market_analysis_system
    ```

3.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    It's best practice to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
    Activate the virtual environment:
    *   On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    *   On Windows:

    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
    handlers=[
        logging.StreamHandler(sys.stdout)
    ]
)

from src.main import MarketAnalysisOrchestrator, DocumentProcessingError, LLMServiceError
from src.modules.document_processor import DocumentProcessor
from src.modules.llm_service import LLMService
from src.modules.report_formatter import ReportFormatter

# 1. Initialize the required services (simulated in this example)
doc_processor = DocumentProcessor()
llm_service = LLMService()
report_formatter = ReportFormatter()

# 2. Create an instance of the orchestrator
orchestrator = MarketAnalysisOrchestrator(doc_processor, llm_service, report_formatter)

# 3. Prepare your input content (simulated document content)
simulated_input = """

```
```

### User Guide
```markdown
# User Guide

This guide provides instructions for using the AI-Driven Market Analysis System to generate comprehensive reports for the AI industry.

## Getting Started

To generate a market analysis report, you typically interact with the system's entry point, which in a full deployment would be a web interface or an API endpoint. For the simulated version, you initiate the process by executing the main script.

**Steps to Generate a Report (Conceptual):**

1.  **Prepare Your Input Document:**
    The system processes information from provided context documents. Conceptually, you would provide the content of a document (e.g., a strategic brief, research paper, or existing market data) that you want the AI to analyze and incorporate into its report. This document can guide the AI on specific areas of focus or provide proprietary insights.
    *   **In the simulated environment:** The `document_content` parameter in `src/main.py`'s `generate_ai_market_report` method serves as this input. You can modify the `simulated_ppt_content` variable in `main.py` to represent your input.

2.  **Define the Report Title:**
    Provide a clear and descriptive title for your desired market analysis report. This title helps the AI understand the primary focus and scope of the report it needs to generate.
    *   **In the simulated environment:** The `report_title` parameter in `src/main.py` defines this.

3.  **Run the Report Generation Process:**
    Execute the main application script. The system will then perform the necessary steps: processing your input, analyzing it with AI (simulated LLM), and formatting the final report.
    *   **In the simulated environment:** Run `python src/main.py`. The generated report will be printed to your console.

## Advanced Usage

### Personalization Capabilities
The AI-Driven Market Analysis System is designed for deep personalization. In a full production deployment, you would typically:
*   **User Profiles:** Maintain a user profile (e.g., through a `User Profile Service` as per architecture) that captures your role (e.g., investor, product manager, CEO), industry focus (e.g., FinTech AI, Healthcare AI), and historical interests.
*   **Dynamic Tailoring:** The system uses this profile to dynamically tailor the content, depth, and specific focus areas of the generated reports. For example, an investor might receive reports emphasizing market valuations and investment trends, while a product manager might get more detail on specific technology adoption and competitive feature sets.
*   **How to Influence Personalization (Conceptual):** While not directly exposed in the current simulated code, in a real API, personalization parameters could be passed as part of the request payload, or inferred from an authenticated user session.

### Custom Report Generation
Beyond standard market overviews, the system enables the generation of highly custom reports on demand.
*   **Specific Queries:** You can request analysis on very niche markets (e.g., "AI in precision agriculture in Southeast Asia"), specific emerging technologies (e.g., "market potential of federated learning"), or detailed competitive landscapes.
*   **On-Demand:** This functionality allows you to obtain insights precisely when you need them for strategic planning, investment decisions, or competitive responses, rather than waiting for pre-scheduled, generic reports.
*   **How to Request Custom Reports (Conceptual):** In a deployed system, this would involve submitting detailed queries or specific contextual data via a dedicated API endpoint or a specialized input form in a UI. The `report_title` and `document_content` parameters in the current `generate_ai_market_report` method hint at this capability.

## Best Practices

*   **Provide Clear Input:** While the system leverages AI, the quality of its output is enhanced by clear and relevant input. Ensure your `document_content` (or equivalent input in a real system) provides sufficient context or specific questions if you're looking for detailed analysis.
*   **Refine Report Titles:** A precise `report_title` helps the LLM focus its generation. Be specific about the industry, scope, and desired outcome (e.g., "Competitive Analysis of Generative AI Startups in 2023" vs. "AI Market").
*   **Understand AI-Driven Benefits:** Appreciate that the system excels at real-time, proactive, and personalized insights. Leverage these strengths to move beyond reactive decision-making.
*   **Iterative Refinement:** For complex analyses, you may want to generate initial reports and then refine your input or follow-up queries to drill down into specific areas of interest.

## Troubleshooting

This section provides guidance on common issues you might encounter and their solutions.

*   **Report Generation Fails with "Document content must be a non-empty string." or "Report title must be a non-empty string."**
    *   **Issue:** You have provided an empty string or `None` for the `document_content` or `report_title` parameters.
    *   **Solution:** Ensure both `document_content` and `report_title` are non-empty strings when calling `generate_ai_market_report`.

*   **Report Generation Fails with "Error extracting insights from document: [Error Message]"**
    *   **Issue:** The `DocumentProcessor` encountered an issue while attempting to process the provided `document_content`. This could happen if the content is malformed or if there's an internal processing error (in a real system, parsing complex files could fail).
    *   **Solution:**
        *   Check the format and content of your input document (simulated `document_content`).
        *   Review the error message for specific clues. In a production system, this might require checking logs of the `Document Ingestion Service`.

*   **Report Generation Fails with "Error generating AI analysis: [Error Message]"**
    *   **Issue:** The `LLMService` failed to generate a response from the underlying Large Language Model. In a real system, this could be due to:
        *   **Network Issues:** Inability to reach the LLM API.
        *   **API Key Problems:** Invalid or expired API credentials.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Too many requests to the LLM API.
        *   **LLM Internal Errors:** The LLM itself encountered an error processing the prompt.
    *   **Solution:**
        *   Verify network connectivity to external LLM providers (if applicable).
        *   Check LLM API status and your API key (in a production environment, managed securely).
        *   If using a real LLM, ensure your prompt is well-formed and does not exceed token limits.
        *   Review the application logs for more detailed error messages from the `LLMService`.

*   **Report Generation Fails with "Error formatting report: [Error Message]" (General Exception)**
    *   **Issue:** An unexpected error occurred during the final formatting of the report. This is less common but indicates an issue within the `ReportFormatter`.
    *   **Solution:** This typically points to an internal system error. Check the application logs for a full traceback and report it to the development team if you are not the developer.

*   **Output Report is Not What I Expected**
    *   **Issue:** The generated report might be too generic, not focused enough, or miss key aspects you anticipated.
    *   **Solution:**
        *   **Refine Input:** Provide more specific details or guiding questions within your `document_content`.
        *   **Adjust Title:** Make your `report_title` more precise to direct the AI's focus.
        *   **Review Context:** Understand that the LLM generates content based on the provided context and its general training data. If critical external data is missing, the report's depth may be limited.
        *   **Simulated vs. Real:** Remember the current code simulates LLM output. A real LLM might produce different results based on its model and current training data.
```

### Developer Guide
```markdown
# Developer Guide

This guide provides an in-depth understanding of the AI-Driven Market Analysis System's architecture, design, and operational aspects for developers.

## Architecture Overview

The system is built upon a **Microservices Architecture** with an **Event-Driven Communication** paradigm, promoting independent development, deployment, and scalability of functionalities. Each microservice internally adopts a **Layered Architecture** (or Clean/Hexagonal Architecture) for separation of concerns and improved testability.

*   **High-Level Architecture:**
    *   **Client Interface:** (Conceptual) A web application or API endpoint for user interaction.
    *   **API Gateway:** (Conceptual) A unified entry point for all client requests, handling routing, authentication, and security.
    *   **Core Microservices:** Specialized services for document ingestion, data processing, AI/LLM integration, knowledge management, and report generation. The current Python code simulates the core orchestration and service interactions.
    *   **Asynchronous Communication:** (Conceptual) A Message Broker (e.g., Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ) facilitates reliable, asynchronous communication between microservices, ensuring loose coupling and resilience.
    *   **Data Stores:** (Conceptual) Diverse data stores optimized for different data types (e.g., document store, vector database, relational database).
    *   **External AI/LLM Providers:** Integration with third-party Large Language Model services (simulated by `LLMService`).
    *   **Monitoring & Logging:** Centralized systems for observing system health and performance (partially implemented with Python's `logging`).

*   **Architecture Pattern:** Microservices Architecture with Event-Driven Communication.

### Component Design

The system is composed of several core logical components, represented as Python classes in the provided code, which would typically be separate microservices in a full deployment:

1.  **API Gateway (Conceptual):**
    *   **Responsibility:** Exposes a unified API, handles request routing, authentication, authorization, and rate limiting.
    *   **Role in System:** The entry point for user requests.

2.  **Input Management Service (Conceptual):**
    *   **Responsibility:** Receives and validates input documents.
    *   **Role in System:** Ensures valid inputs are ingested.

3.  **Document Ingestion Service (`DocumentProcessor` simulation):**
    *   **Responsibility:** Parses various document formats, extracts text and structured data, cleans and normalizes content.
    *   **Data Flow:** Consumes "DocumentUploaded" events (conceptual) -> Parses content -> Stores raw extracted data -> Publishes "DocumentProcessed" event (conceptual).
    *   **Current Simulation:** `DocumentProcessor.process_document` simulates this by returning hardcoded insights.

4.  **Knowledge Base Service (Conceptual, partly simulated by `DocumentProcessor` output):**
    *   **Responsibility:** Processes extracted text to generate semantic embeddings, builds a knowledge graph, stores embeddings in a Vector Database for semantic search.
    *   **Role in System:** Provides relevant context for LLMs.

5.  **AI Orchestration Service (`MarketAnalysisOrchestrator`):**
    *   **Responsibility:** The intelligence core. Orchestrates complex AI tasks, formulates prompts based on user requests and retrieved context, interacts with external LLM Providers, handles multi-turn conversations, and refines LLM outputs. It performs the "analysis and synthesis processes" and prepares insights.
    *   **Data Flow:** Receives analysis request (or "ReportAnalysisRequest" event) -> Queries Knowledge Base (simulated by `DocumentProcessor` output) -> Formulates LLM prompts -> Sends requests to LLM Provider Integration -> Processes LLM responses -> Publishes "AnalysisCompleted" event (conceptual).
    *   **Current Implementation:** `MarketAnalysisOrchestrator` directly calls `DocumentProcessor`, `LLMService`, and `ReportFormatter`.

6.  **LLM Provider Integration (`LLMService`):**
    *   **Responsibility:** Acts as a proxy or direct interface to external Large Language Model APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini).
    *   **Data Flow:** Receives requests from AI Orchestration Service -> Forwards to external LLM API -> Returns raw LLM output.
    *   **Current Simulation:** `LLMService.generate_response` returns a fixed placeholder string.

7.  **Report Generation Service (`ReportFormatter`):**
    *   **Responsibility:** Takes synthesized insights, applies report templates, incorporates personalization rules, and formats the final report. Addresses "custom report generation."
    *   **Data Flow:** Consumes "AnalysisCompleted" event (conceptual) -> Retrieves templates/personalization -> Structures and formats content -> Publishes "ReportGenerated" event (conceptual).
    *   **Current Implementation:** `ReportFormatter.format_report` performs basic string formatting.

8.  **Output Delivery Service (Conceptual):**
    *   **Responsibility:** Handles the delivery of the final report in the requested format (e.g., plain text via API response, downloadable file, email).

9.  **User Profile Service (Conceptual):**
    *   **Responsibility:** Manages user preferences, historical requests, and personalization settings.

10. **Message Broker (Conceptual):**
    *   **Responsibility:** Enables asynchronous, decoupled communication between services using topics/queues (e.g., Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ).

### Technology Stack (Conceptual)

*   **Programming Languages & Frameworks:** Python (with FastAPI/Flask for backend services), Java/Kotlin (Spring Boot).
*   **Document Parsing:** Python libraries like `python-pptx`, `openpyxl`, `PyPDF2`, `tika-python`.
*   **Databases & Storage Solutions:** MongoDB/Cassandra/S3 (Document Store/Data Lake), Pinecone/Milvus/Weaviate (Vector Database), PostgreSQL/MySQL (Relational Database), Redis (Caching).
*   **AI/ML & NLP:** OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini (LLMs), Hugging Face Transformers (Embedding Models).
*   **Infrastructure & Deployment:** AWS/Azure/GCP (Cloud), Docker (Containerization), Kubernetes (Orchestration), Apache Kafka/RabbitMQ (Message Broker), Prometheus/Grafana/ELK Stack (Monitoring & Logging), Terraform/CloudFormation (IaC), Jenkins/GitLab CI/CD/GitHub Actions (CI/CD).

### Design Patterns

*   **Architectural Patterns:**
    *   **Microservices Architecture:** For modularity, scalability, independent deployment.
    *   **Event-Driven Architecture:** For asynchronous, decoupled communication.
    *   **Layered Architecture / Clean Architecture:** Within individual microservices for separation of concerns.
    *   **API Gateway Pattern:** For centralized entry point.
    *   **Database per Service Pattern:** Each microservice manages its own data store.

*   **Design Patterns (Implementation Level, as seen in code):**
    *   **Dependency Injection:** Explicitly used in `MarketAnalysisOrchestrator`'s constructor, adhering to the Dependency Inversion Principle.
    *   **Orchestrator Pattern:** `MarketAnalysisOrchestrator` coordinates calls to other components.

7.  **Pull Requests:** Submit pull requests to the `main` branch, providing a detailed description of your changes and why they are needed.

## Testing Instructions

The project includes a `tests` directory with unit tests to ensure the correctness of the simulated components.

1.  **Navigate to the project root directory.**
    ```bash
    cd market_analysis_system
    ```

2.  **Ensure your virtual environment is active.**
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Run all unit tests:**
    ```bash
    python -m unittest discover tests
    ```
    This command will discover and run all tests in the `tests` directory. You should see output indicating the number of tests run and whether they passed or failed.

**Running Specific Tests:**
To run a specific test file, for example, `test_main.py`:
```bash
python -m unittest tests.test_main
```

**Testing Philosophy:**
*   **Unit Tests:** Focus on testing individual classes and methods in isolation, using mocking (`unittest.mock.MagicMock`) for dependencies. This is exemplified in `tests/test_main.py` for `MarketAnalysisOrchestrator` and its component modules.
*   **Error Path Testing:** Critical failure scenarios (e.g., document processing failure, LLM service errors) are explicitly tested to ensure robust error handling and proper exception propagation.

## Deployment Guide

Deploying the AI-Driven Market Analysis System in a production environment involves transitioning from the simulated, monolithic-like Python script to a fully distributed microservices architecture.

1.  **Containerization:**
    *   Containerize each logical microservice (e.g., `Document Ingestion Service`, `AI Orchestration Service`, `Report Generation Service`) using Docker. Each service should have its own `Dockerfile`.

2.  **Orchestration with Kubernetes:**
    *   Deploy the containerized services to a Kubernetes cluster (e.g., Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)).
    *   Define Kubernetes manifests (Deployments, Services, Ingress, ConfigMaps, Secrets) for each microservice.
    *   Implement horizontal pod autoscaling (HPA) to scale services based on CPU/memory utilization or custom metrics.

3.  **Message Broker Setup:**
    *   Set up a robust and scalable message broker (e.g., Apache Kafka cluster, RabbitMQ).
    *   Configure topics/queues for inter-service communication (e.g., `document_uploaded_events`, `analysis_requests`, `report_generated_events`).

4.  **Data Store Provisioning:**
    *   Provision and configure appropriate data stores as per the architecture:
        *   Vector Database (e.g., Pinecone, Milvus) for embeddings.
        *   Document Store (e.g., MongoDB, S3) for raw and extracted text.
        *   Relational Database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for application metadata.
        *   Caching layer (e.g., Redis).
    *   Ensure data encryption at rest and in transit.

5.  **Secrets Management:**
    *   Integrate a secrets management solution (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault) to securely store and retrieve sensitive credentials (LLM API keys, database passwords). Avoid hardcoding secrets.

6.  **CI/CD Pipeline:**
    *   Implement a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, GitHub Actions).
    *   Automate build, test, container image creation, and deployment to the Kubernetes cluster upon code merges.

7.  **Monitoring and Logging:**
    *   Set up centralized logging (e.g., ELK Stack, Splunk) for collecting and analyzing logs from all microservices.
    *   Implement a monitoring system (e.g., Prometheus and Grafana) to collect metrics (CPU, memory, request latency, error rates) from services and visualize system health.
    *   Utilize distributed tracing (e.g., OpenTelemetry, Jaeger) to trace requests across multiple services.

8.  **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**
    *   Manage all infrastructure components (Kubernetes cluster, databases, message broker, networking) using IaC tools like Terraform or CloudFormation for consistent and reproducible deployments.

9.  **Network Configuration:**
    *   Configure appropriate network policies, firewalls, and security groups to secure inter-service communication and external access.
    *   Ensure all external communication uses TLS/SSL (HTTPS).

10. **Scalability and Resilience Testing:**
    *   Perform comprehensive load testing and resilience testing to ensure the deployed system can handle expected loads and gracefully recover from failures.

### Quality and Security Notes
```markdown
# Quality and Security Report

This report summarizes the quality and security assessments of the AI-Driven Market Analysis System, along with its performance characteristics and known limitations.

## Code Quality Summary
**Quality Score: 9/10** (for the conceptual and simulated code)

**Strengths:**
*   **Excellent Modularity and Separation of Concerns:** The code demonstrates a well-structured design with clear responsibilities for `MarketAnalysisOrchestrator`, `DocumentProcessor`, `LLMService`, and `ReportFormatter`, aligning with a microservices/layered architecture.
*   **Strong Adherence to Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** Dependencies are injected via constructors, enhancing testability and flexibility.
*   **Clear Naming Conventions:** Highly descriptive and Pythonic names contribute to excellent readability.
*   **Comprehensive Documentation:** Consistent use of docstrings and inline comments explains purpose, arguments, returns, and simulation aspects.
*   **High-Quality Unit Tests:** Effective use of `unittest` and `MagicMock` for isolation. Tests cover positive flows and critical negative scenarios (e.g., error handling).
*   **Clear Simulation Strategy:** Explicitly indicates where real-world complexities are simulated, managing expectations.
*   **Robust Error Handling:** Custom exceptions (`DocumentProcessingError`, `LLMServiceError`) are implemented, providing granular error messages and preventing information leakage. `try-except` blocks are strategically placed.
*   **Comprehensive Logging:** Replaced `print()` with Python's standard `logging` module across all components, crucial for monitoring and debugging.
*   **Basic Input Validation:** Initial checks for non-empty string inputs (`document_content`, `report_title`) prevent basic malformed inputs.

**Areas for Improvement (for transition to production):**
*   **Full Error Handling Implementation:** While improved, a production system would need even more sophisticated error recovery, retries with backoff, and circuit breakers.
*   **Robust Configuration Management:** Hardcoded simulated behaviors should be externalized (e.g., LLM API keys, endpoints, parsing rules).
*   **Dynamic Prompt Building:** Static parts of LLM prompts should ideally be loaded from configuration or a knowledge base rather than hardcoded.
*   **Asynchronous Operations:** The current synchronous flow in `main.py` needs to be refactored to truly asynchronous, event-driven communication for real-world microservices deployment to improve throughput.

## Security Assessment
**Security Score: 6/10** (for the *simulated* code; would be lower for real production system without full measures)

**Critical Issues (Conceptual Risks for Production):**
1.  **Lack of Robust Input Validation and Sanitization:** Direct string inputs (`document_content`, `prompt`) without thorough validation/sanitization could lead to injection attacks (Prompt Injection, XSS, code injection) if inputs originate from untrusted sources in a real system.
    *   **Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive file type validation, size limits, and content scanning for ingested documents. Perform strict sanitization for all user-controlled input feeding into LLMs or report rendering.
2.  **Inadequate Error Handling (Potential Information Leakage):** While improved, improper error handling can still expose sensitive stack traces or internal details if not fully controlled.
    *   **Recommendation:** Centralize exception handling, log full details internally, and return only generic, user-friendly error messages to clients.

**Medium Priority Issues (Conceptual Risks for Production):**
1.  **No Authentication or Authorization:** The simulated system lacks mechanisms to verify user identity or permissions.
    *   **Recommendation:** Implement OAuth2/JWT authentication and RBAC authorization at the API Gateway and within services.
2.  **Lack of Secrets Management:** Real LLM API keys/credentials are not managed securely in the simulation.
    *   **Recommendation:** Use dedicated secrets management services (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault) for all sensitive credentials.
3.  **Limited Logging and Monitoring:** `print()` statements replaced with `logging`, but full production observability (structured logs, metrics, tracing) is still needed.
    *   **Recommendation:** Implement structured logging, centralize logs, and set up comprehensive monitoring and alerting for security events.

**Low Priority Issues (Conceptual Risks for Production):**
1.  **Absence of Resource Management/Rate Limiting:** No controls to prevent abuse (e.g., excessive LLM calls, DoS).
    *   **Recommendation:** Implement rate limiting at the API Gateway and internally for external API calls.
2.  **Static/Hardcoded Prompt Construction:** While well-defined, robust prompt injection defenses require more advanced techniques for user-contributed prompt elements.

**Security Best Practices Followed:**
*   **Modular Design:** Facilitates isolated security review.
*   **Dependency Inversion:** Good for testability and flexibility.
*   **Unit Testing (including error paths):** Indirectly contributes to security by reducing bugs.

**Compliance Notes:**
*   **OWASP Top 10 (2021) Considerations:** Issues directly relate to A03: Injection, A01: Broken Access Control, A05: Security Misconfiguration, and A09: Security Logging and Monitoring Failures.
*   **Industry Standards:** Compliance with GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA (if applicable), or SOC 2 would require significant additional measures for data privacy, access controls, audit logging, and encryption.

## Performance Characteristics
**Performance Score: 7/10** (for conceptual design; simulated code is efficient due to mocks)

**Critical Performance Issues (Conceptual for Real-world):**
1.  **LLM Latency & Cost:** External LLM API calls are the primary real-world bottleneck due to network latency, processing time, and cost.
2.  **Document Processing Complexity:** Real parsing and embedding generation can be CPU/memory intensive, scaling with document size.
3.  **Synchronous Execution Flow (in current simulation):** The `MarketAnalysisOrchestrator` performs steps synchronously. In a real system, this would severely limit throughput for concurrent requests.

**Optimization Opportunities (for Production):**
1.  **Asynchronous Processing:** Implement `asyncio` and `await` for I/O-bound operations and transition to a fully event-driven flow (Message Broker) for better throughput and responsiveness.
2.  **Caching Strategies:** Implement caching for LLM responses, processed context/embeddings, and user profiles (e.g., using Redis).
3.  **LLM Prompt Optimization:** Minimize token usage with concise prompts and contextual retrieval (RAG). Choose appropriate LLM models.
4.  **Batch Processing:** Batch requests to LLMs or document processors where feasible.
5.  **Efficient Data Sources:** Optimize database queries and use streaming parsers for large documents.

**Algorithmic Analysis:**
*   **`DocumentProcessor.process_document`:** O(1) simulated; real-world: O(N) due to parsing/NLP.
*   **`LLMService.generate_response`:** O(1) simulated; real-world: dominated by network latency and LLM computation.
*   **`ReportFormatter.format_report`:** O(L) (length of LLM output), efficient.
*   **`_build_llm_prompt`:** O(P) (length of prompt), efficient.

**Scalability Assessment:**
The **Microservices Architecture** with **Event-Driven Communication** is fundamentally designed for excellent scalability, supporting horizontal scaling of individual services. Bottlenecks will be external LLM provider limits, data store performance, and message broker throughput.

**Recommendations:**
*   Prioritize asynchronous implementation with a message broker.
*   Implement robust caching (LLM responses, context).
*   Optimize LLM interactions (token management, RAG).
*   Implement comprehensive monitoring, profiling, and distributed tracing.
*   Conduct thorough load and stress testing.

## Known Limitations
*   **Simulated Functionality:** The current codebase serves as a conceptual representation. Actual file I/O, external API calls to LLMs, and complex data processing are simulated. A production system requires real implementations of these components.
*   **Limited Data for "Comprehensive" Scope:** The analysis is based on the principles outlined in provided (conceptual) documents (like `test_ppt.pptx`) regarding *how* AI-driven market analysis is performed, rather than exhaustive, real-time market data on the AI industry itself. The "comprehensive" nature of the report generated is a placeholder reflecting the *capabilities* of such a system.
*   **Static LLM Output:** The `LLMService` currently returns a fixed, hardcoded market analysis report. In a real system, this would be dynamically generated by a live LLM, leading to variable and potentially more current outputs.
*   **No Real-time Data Ingestion:** The system simulates document content. A production system would integrate with live data feeds for continuous updates.
*   **Security & Performance are Conceptual:** While architectural considerations for security and performance are present, their full implementation requires substantial effort beyond this conceptual code.

## Migration Guides

### Migrating from Pre-Refactoring Code to Version 1.0.0

This guide outlines the steps to update your codebase to the refactored Version 1.0.0. The refactoring primarily focused on internal robustness, logging, and error handling without altering the core public interfaces, ensuring a smooth transition for direct consumers of the `MarketAnalysisOrchestrator` class.

**Steps:**

1.  **Update Source Files:**
    Replace the contents of the following files with their respective refactored code from Version 1.0.0:
    *   `src/main.py`
    *   `src/modules/document_processor.py`
    *   `src/modules/llm_service.py`
    *   `src/modules/report_formatter.py`

2.  **Update Test Files:**
    Replace the contents of `tests/test_main.py` with the updated unit tests from Version 1.0.0. These new tests include assertions for logging output and the new custom exception types.

3.  **Review Logging Configuration:**
    The refactored `src/main.py` now configures a basic Python `logging` setup.
    *   If your application has a pre-existing global logging configuration, ensure that it is compatible with or overrides the basic configuration provided. The new code uses `logging.getLogger(__name__)` within modules, which respects the root logger's configuration if set.
    *   All `print()` statements previously used for status updates have been replaced with `logger.info()`, `logger.debug()`, or `logger.error()`.

4.  **No New Dependencies:**
    This refactoring does not introduce any new external Python package dependencies. No `pip install` commands are needed for this specific update.

5.  **Review Error Handling in Calling Code:**
    If your application code directly calls `MarketAnalysisOrchestrator.generate_ai_market_report` and currently catches a generic `Exception`, consider updating your `except` blocks to handle the more specific custom exceptions introduced: `ValueError`, `DocumentProcessingError`, and `LLMServiceError`. This allows for more granular and context-specific error handling at the calling layer.

    **Before (Example):**
    ```python
    try:
        report = orchestrator.generate_ai_market_report(...)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
    ```

    **After (Recommended):**
    ```python
    from src.main import DocumentProcessingError, LLMServiceError # and ValueError

    try:
        report = orchestrator.generate_ai_market_report(...)
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Input validation error: {e}")
    except DocumentProcessingError as e:
        print(f"Failed to process document: {e}")
    except LLMServiceError as e:
        print(f"Failed to get AI analysis: {e}")
    except Exception as e: # Catch any other unexpected errors
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
    ```

Following these steps will ensure your project benefits from the improved quality, security foundations, and enhanced observability of the refactored codebase.
```
