## Requirements Analysis

The user's request is to "Create a comprehensive market analysis report for the AI industry". This analysis outlines the requirements for fulfilling that request.

### Functional Requirements
- The system shall generate a market analysis report focused on the Artificial Intelligence (AI) industry.
- The report shall be comprehensive, covering various aspects relevant to a market analysis.
- The report shall synthesize information and insights from the provided source documents.
- The report should incorporate details related to AI-driven market insights, including data collection methods, analysis and synthesis processes (e.g., using LLMs), personalization capabilities, and custom report generation as described in the `test_ppt.pptx` document.
- The report should address the benefits of AI-driven approaches over traditional methods, such as overcoming slow delivery, lack of personalization, high costs, and reactive insights.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance requirements:**
    - The report generation process should be efficient to provide timely insights.
    - The output report should reflect current or near real-time market developments where possible, aligning with the concept of "Continuous Updates" mentioned in `test_ppt.pptx`.
- **Security requirements:**
    - Any underlying data sources or processes used for generating the report should adhere to data security and privacy best practices. (Note: This is a general requirement for market analysis systems, not directly applicable to the current task of synthesizing from provided documents).
- **Scalability requirements:**
    - The underlying system or process used to generate such reports should be scalable to accommodate an increasing volume of data sources and diverse research requirements for future reports.
- **Usability requirements:**
    - The generated report must be clear, well-structured, and easy to understand for a business audience.
    - The language used should be professional and informative.
    - The report should present insights concisely and effectively.

### Technical Constraints
- The primary source of information for the market analysis report will be the provided input documents, specifically `test_ppt.pptx`.
- The output format for the report will be text-based, generated by the LLM.
- Limitations of the available data within the provided documents will constrain the depth and breadth of the "comprehensive" analysis.

### Assumptions and Clarifications
- **Assumptions made:**
    - The term "AI industry" is broad and encompasses various applications, technologies, and companies involved in Artificial Intelligence.
    - "Comprehensive" implies covering key market aspects like trends, challenges, opportunities, and competitive landscape, drawing from the provided `test_ppt.pptx` content on market insights.
    - The primary intent is to demonstrate the ability to synthesize information from the provided context to create a report, rather than generating new market data or conducting external research.
    - The numerical data in `test.xlsx` is generic and not specifically related to the AI industry, and thus may not be directly incorporated unless a specific contextual link can be established.
- **Questions that need clarification:**
    - What specific sub-sectors or applications within the AI industry should be highlighted (e.g., Generative AI, Machine Learning, Robotics, Computer Vision, NLP)?
    - What is the intended audience for this report (e.g., investors, business strategists, product managers, general public)? This will influence the level of technical detail and business language.
    - Are there any specific metrics or quantitative data points that are expected, beyond what is explicitly available in `test_ppt.pptx`?
    - What is the desired length and structure for the "comprehensive" report (e.g., executive summary, introduction, market overview, competitive analysis, future outlook)?
    - Is there a preference for the tone or perspective of the report (e.g., objective, optimistic, cautious)?

### Risk Assessment
- **Potential technical risks:**
    - **Insufficient Data for "Comprehensive" Scope:** The provided documents, especially `test_ppt.pptx`, describe a *process* for AI-driven market analysis but do not contain exhaustive, detailed market data on the AI industry itself. This limits the ability to provide a truly "comprehensive" and in-depth report without external knowledge.
    - **Outdated Information:** Market dynamics in the AI industry evolve rapidly. Information from `test_ppt.pptx` might not capture the latest trends or competitive landscape if the document itself is not current.
    - **Misinterpretation of "Comprehensive":** Without further clarification, the definition of "comprehensive" might differ between the user's expectation and the system's ability based solely on the provided documents.
- **Mitigation strategies:**
    - **Clarify Scope and Depth:** Engage with the user to clarify the desired depth and specific content areas required for "comprehensive" coverage, managing expectations regarding data availability.
    - **Acknowledge Data Limitations:** Explicitly state in the generated report that the analysis is based on the provided documents and may not reflect the absolute latest market conditions or an exhaustive data set.
    - **Focus on AI-Driven Process:** If detailed market data is scarce, emphasize the *methodology* of AI-driven market analysis as described in `test_ppt.pptx`, positioning the report as an example of how such a process generates insights, rather than a definitive market study.
