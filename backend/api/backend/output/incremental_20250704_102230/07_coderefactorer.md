## Refactored Code Implementation

### Summary of Changes
The refactoring focused on enhancing robustness, observability, and configurability, directly addressing feedback from the Quality, Security, and Performance reviews while maintaining the original functionality.

Key improvements include:
- **Enhanced Error Handling:** Implemented `try-except` blocks with custom exceptions (`DocumentProcessingError`, `LLMServiceError`) to provide more granular and user-friendly error messages, preventing sensitive information leakage.
- **Comprehensive Logging:** Replaced `print()` statements with Python's built-in `logging` module across all components, allowing for structured and configurable logging output crucial for monitoring and debugging in a production environment.
- **Conceptual Configuration Management:** Refactored the `_build_llm_prompt` method to better separate the static prompt components from dynamic context, indicating where a real system would draw configurable or knowledge-base driven content. Comments were added to highlight areas for true external configuration (e.g., LLM API keys).
- **Basic Input Validation:** Introduced simple validation checks for input parameters to prevent basic malformed inputs and guide future robust validation.
- **Improved Test Coverage for Error Paths:** Updated unit tests to specifically assert against the new custom exception types and verify logging behavior, ensuring the robustness of error handling.
- **Architectural Clarifications:** Added comments to highlight the transition from simulated synchronous execution to the asynchronous, event-driven model envisioned in the architecture.

        logger.info("  [ReportFormatter] Report formatting simulation complete.")
        return formatted_content

```
### Security Improvements
1.  **Enhanced Error Handling to Prevent Information Leakage:**
    *   Introduced specific custom exceptions (`DocumentProcessingError`, `LLMServiceError`) in `src/main.py`.
    *   `try-except` blocks are now used in `MarketAnalysisOrchestrator.generate_ai_market_report` to catch these specific errors. Instead of propagating raw exceptions, a more controlled error message is raised, preventing the exposure of sensitive stack traces or internal system details to potential attackers.
    *   `logging.error` calls include `exc_info=True` to log full tracebacks internally for debugging, while public-facing errors are generic.
2.  **Conceptual Input Validation:**
    *   Added basic checks for `document_content` and `report_title` in `generate_ai_market_report` to ensure they are non-empty strings. This is a foundational step for preventing common injection vulnerabilities (e.g., ensuring string inputs rather than unexpected types).
    *   Comments highlight that more robust validation (e.g., file type, size, content sanitization) would be implemented in a real `Input Management Service` to mitigate risks like malicious file uploads or prompt injection.
3.  **Improved Logging for Auditability and Detection:**
    *   Replaced all `print()` statements with Python's standard `logging` module. This allows for structured logging, configurable log levels (INFO, ERROR, DEBUG), and future integration with centralized logging systems.
    *   Proper logging is crucial for detecting suspicious activities, tracking unauthorized access attempts, and providing an audit trail for security incidents.

### Performance Optimizations
1.  **Acknowledge Asynchronous Flow (Conceptual):**
    *   Added comments in `src/main.py` (e.g., in `generate_ai_market_report`) to explicitly mention that in a real microservices architecture, steps like document ingestion and LLM calls would be handled asynchronously via event-driven communication (e.g., message brokers). This design decision, while not fully implemented in this simulated code, is the primary architectural improvement for performance (throughput and responsiveness).
2.  **LLM Prompt Structure for Efficiency:**
    *   The `_build_llm_prompt` method was refactored to logically separate different sections of the prompt. While still hardcoded for simulation, this structure conceptually supports easier management and optimization of prompt components in a real system. For instance, dynamically including only the most relevant context from a `Knowledge Base Service` (as suggested in `Performance Review`) would reduce token count and LLM processing time.
3.  **Logging Performance Awareness:**
    *   Using `logging` instead of `print` generally has a minor performance overhead, but it's a necessary trade-off for observability. `logging.debug` is used for verbose outputs, allowing them to be turned off in production to minimize I/O overhead.

### Quality Enhancements
1.  **Robust Error Handling:**
    *   Implemented custom exception classes (`DocumentProcessingError`, `LLMServiceError`) derived from `Exception`. This improves the clarity and maintainability of error handling logic, allowing specific types of failures to be caught and managed precisely.
    *   `try-except` blocks are strategically placed in the orchestrator to catch potential failures from downstream services, ensuring the application handles unexpected conditions gracefully.
2.  **Centralized Logging:**
    *   Integrated Python's `logging` module throughout `src/main.py` and all modules (`document_processor.py`, `llm_service.py`, `report_formatter.py`).
    *   Configured a basic logger to output to `stdout`, providing clear, timestamped, and level-based messages. This significantly improves debuggability, traceability, and overall operational visibility compared to simple `print` statements.
3.  **Code Readability and Maintainability:**
    *   The `_build_llm_prompt` method was visually organized to separate the distinct conceptual parts of the LLM instruction. This makes the prompt construction logic easier to understand and modify.
    *   Added more specific comments in areas that highlight the distinction between simulated behavior and real-world microservice interactions, improving clarity for developers.
4.  **Adherence to Clean Code Principles:**
    *   Continued adherence to the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) with dependency injection remains strong.
    *   Clear separation of concerns is maintained, with each module having a well-defined responsibility.

### Migration Guide
This refactored code maintains the public interface of the `MarketAnalysisOrchestrator` class and its `generate_ai_market_report` method. Therefore, **no breaking changes** are introduced for consumers interacting with this class.

**Steps to Migrate:**
1.  **Replace Old Code:** Replace the contents of `src/main.py`, `src/modules/document_processor.py`, `src/modules/llm_service.py`, and `src/modules/report_formatter.py` with the new refactored code.
2.  **Update Tests:** Replace the contents of `tests/test_main.py` with the updated unit tests. The new tests incorporate assertions for logging and custom exceptions.
3.  **Logging Configuration:** If your existing system has a global logging configuration, ensure it is compatible with the basic configuration provided in `src/main.py` or integrate the new logging calls into your existing setup. The current setup configures a root logger to output to `sys.stdout`.
4.  **No New Dependencies:** This refactoring does not introduce any new external Python package dependencies.
5.  **Review Error Handling:** If your application currently catches generic `Exception` from the orchestrator, consider updating it to catch the more specific `ValueError`, `DocumentProcessingError`, and `LLMServiceError` exceptions for more granular error handling at the calling layer.
