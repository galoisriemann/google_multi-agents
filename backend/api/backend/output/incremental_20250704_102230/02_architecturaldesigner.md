## System Architecture Design

The primary goal of this system is to generate comprehensive market analysis reports, specifically for the AI industry, leveraging provided source documents and applying AI-driven insights. The architecture is designed to be scalable, maintainable, and to embody the principles of modern software development.

### High-Level Architecture
The system employs a **Microservices Architecture** pattern, allowing for independent development, deployment, and scaling of distinct functionalities. Communication between services is primarily **Event-Driven**, ensuring loose coupling and resilience. Within each microservice, a **Layered Architecture** (or Clean/Hexagonal Architecture) is adopted to maintain separation of concerns and testability.

*   **Overall System Design:**
    *   **Client Interface:** Web application or API endpoint for users to submit requests and retrieve reports.
    *   **API Gateway:** Serves as the single entry point for all client requests, handling routing, authentication, and security.
    *   **Core Microservices:** Specialized services handling document ingestion, data processing, AI/LLM integration, knowledge management, and report generation.
    *   **Asynchronous Communication:** A Message Broker facilitates reliable, asynchronous communication between microservices.
    *   **Data Stores:** Diverse data stores optimized for different data types (e.g., document store, vector database, relational database).
    *   **External AI/LLM Providers:** Integration with third-party Large Language Model services.
    *   **Monitoring & Logging:** Centralized systems for observing system health and performance.

*   **Architecture Pattern:** Microservices Architecture with Event-Driven Communication.

### Component Design

**Core Components and their Responsibilities:**

1.  **API Gateway:**
    *   **Responsibility:** Exposes a unified API for external clients, handles request routing, authentication, authorization, and rate limiting.
    *   **Interface:** RESTful API endpoints for report requests, document uploads, and report retrieval.
    *   **Data Flow:** Receives client requests -> Routes to relevant microservice (e.g., Input Management Service, Report Generation Service).

2.  **Input Management Service:**
    *   **Responsibility:** Receives and validates input documents (e.g., `test_ppt.pptx`, `test.xlsx`).
    *   **Interface:** `POST /documents/upload` endpoint for file uploads.
    *   **Data Flow:** Receives document -> Performs basic validation -> Stores raw document temporarily -> Publishes "DocumentUploaded" event to Message Broker.

3.  **Document Ingestion Service:**
    *   **Responsibility:** Subscribes to "DocumentUploaded" events, parses various document formats (PPTX, XLSX, PDF), extracts text, images, and structured data. Cleans and normalizes extracted content.
    *   **Interface:** Consumes "DocumentUploaded" event; Publishes "DocumentProcessed" event.
    *   **Data Flow:** Consumes "DocumentUploaded" event -> Uses parsing libraries -> Stores raw extracted text/data in Data Lake/Document Store -> Publishes "DocumentProcessed" event to Message Broker.

4.  **Knowledge Base Service:**
    *   **Responsibility:** Subscribes to "DocumentProcessed" events. Processes extracted text to generate semantic embeddings and potentially build a knowledge graph (e.g., identifying entities, relationships, key themes). Stores embeddings in a Vector Database for efficient semantic search and context retrieval.
    *   **Interface:** Consumes "DocumentProcessed" event; Provides `search_similar_documents(query, k)` and `get_document_context(document_id)` APIs.
    *   **Data Flow:** Consumes "DocumentProcessed" event -> Uses embedding models -> Stores embeddings in Vector Database -> Publishes "KnowledgeBaseUpdated" event.

5.  **AI Orchestration Service:**
    *   **Responsibility:** The intelligence core. Orchestrates complex AI tasks, including formulating prompts based on user requests and retrieved context, interacting with external LLM Providers, handling multi-turn conversations, and refining LLM outputs. It embodies the "analysis and synthesis processes" and prepares insights for report generation.
    *   **Interface:** Consumes "ReportAnalysisRequest" event (triggered by user report request); Provides `perform_analysis(context, query, personalization_params)` API; Publishes "AnalysisCompleted" event.
    *   **Data Flow:** Receives analysis request (from a Report Request Service or directly) -> Queries Knowledge Base Service for relevant context -> Formulates LLM prompts -> Sends requests to LLM Provider Integration -> Processes LLM responses (e.g., sentiment analysis, entity extraction, summarization) -> Publishes "AnalysisCompleted" event to Message Broker.

6.  **LLM Provider Integration (External Service):**
    *   **Responsibility:** Acts as a proxy or direct interface to external Large Language Model APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, custom fine-tuned models).
    *   **Interface:** Standardized API calls (e.g., `POST /generate_text`).
    *   **Data Flow:** Receives requests from AI Orchestration Service -> Forwards to external LLM API -> Returns raw LLM output.

7.  **Report Generation Service:**
    *   **Responsibility:** Subscribes to "AnalysisCompleted" events. Takes the synthesized insights from AI Orchestration Service, applies report templates, incorporates personalization rules (e.g., from User Profile Service), and formats the final report. This addresses "custom report generation."
    *   **Interface:** Consumes "AnalysisCompleted" event; Publishes "ReportGenerated" event.
    *   **Data Flow:** Consumes "AnalysisCompleted" event -> Retrieves report templates/personalization settings -> Structures and formats the report content -> Publishes "ReportGenerated" event to Message Broker.

8.  **Output Delivery Service:**
    *   **Responsibility:** Subscribes to "ReportGenerated" events. Handles the delivery of the final report in the requested format (e.g., plain text via API response, downloadable file, email).
    *   **Interface:** Consumes "ReportGenerated" event.
    *   **Data Flow:** Consumes "ReportGenerated" event -> Prepares report for delivery -> Sends report back to client via API Gateway or other channels.

9.  **User Profile Service (Optional but Recommended for Personalization):**
    *   **Responsibility:** Manages user preferences, historical requests, and personalization settings crucial for "personalization capabilities."
    *   **Interface:** CRUD operations for user profiles.
    *   **Data Flow:** Provides data to Report Generation Service for personalization.

10. **Message Broker (e.g., Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ):**
    *   **Responsibility:** Enables asynchronous, decoupled communication between services using topics/queues.
    *   **Data Flow:** Services publish events to topics, other services subscribe to relevant topics.

### Technology Stack

*   **Programming Languages & Frameworks:**
    *   **Backend Services:** Python (with FastAPI/Flask for rapid development and strong AI/ML ecosystem) or Java/Kotlin (with Spring Boot for robust enterprise applications). Python is preferred given the heavy AI/ML component.

    *   **Microservices Architecture:** For modularity, scalability, and independent deployment.
    *   **Event-Driven Architecture:** For asynchronous communication, loose coupling, and resilience between services.
    *   **Layered Architecture / Clean Architecture / Hexagonal Architecture:** Applied within individual microservices to separate domain logic from infrastructure concerns, improving testability and maintainability.
    *   **API Gateway Pattern:** For centralized entry point and cross-cutting concerns.
    *   **Database per Service Pattern:** Each microservice manages its own data store, promoting autonomy.

*   **Design Patterns (Implementation Level):**
    *   **Strategy Pattern:** For dynamic selection of document parsers based on file type, or different report formatting strategies.
    *   **Builder Pattern:** For constructing complex report objects with various sections and formatting.
    *   **Repository Pattern:** To abstract data access logic from domain models.
    *   **Factory Method / Abstract Factory:** For creating instances of LLM client integrations or document processing modules.
    *   **Observer Pattern:** The core pattern for event-driven communication (services observing events published by others).
    *   **Orchestrator Pattern:** The AI Orchestration Service acts as an orchestrator for LLM interactions and context retrieval.
    *   **Circuit Breaker:** To prevent cascading failures when external services (like LLM APIs) are unresponsive.
    *   **Idempotent Consumer:** For ensuring event consumers process messages only once, even if messages are delivered multiple times.

### Quality Attributes

*   **Scalability:**
    *   **Microservices:** Allows individual services to be scaled independently based on demand (e.g., Document Ingestion Service scaling up during peak upload times).
    *   **Containerization & Orchestration (Kubernetes):** Enables horizontal scaling by adding more instances of services automatically.
    *   **Asynchronous Communication (Message Broker):** Decouples services, allowing them to process tasks at their own pace and absorb load spikes.
    *   **Stateless Services:** Where possible, services are designed to be stateless, facilitating easier scaling and resilience.
    *   **Distributed Data Stores:** Vector databases and document stores are designed for horizontal scalability.

*   **Security:**
    *   **API Gateway:** Enforces authentication (e.g., OAuth2, JWT) and authorization at the perimeter.
    *   **Least Privilege Principle:** Services only have access to resources and data necessary for their function.
    *   **Data Encryption:** Data encrypted at rest (e.g., database encryption, S3 encryption) and in transit (TLS/SSL for all inter-service and client-service communication).
    *   **Secrets Management:** Secure management of API keys (e.g., for LLMs) using dedicated services (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault).
    *   **Input Validation:** Robust validation at all service boundaries to prevent injection attacks and malformed data.
    *   **Access Control:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for internal system access and external user permissions.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Continuous scanning and penetration testing of the system.

*   **Performance Optimizations:**
    *   **Asynchronous Processing:** Long-running tasks (e.g., document parsing, LLM calls) are handled asynchronously, preventing blocking of primary request threads.
    *   **Caching:** Redis used for caching frequently accessed data (e.g., user profiles, common analysis results).
    *   **Optimized Data Retrieval:** Use of Vector Databases for efficient semantic search, and appropriate indexing in relational and document stores.
    *   **Efficient LLM Prompting:** Strategies like prompt compression, few-shot learning, and careful token management to optimize LLM usage and reduce latency.
    *   **Parallel Processing:** Multiple document ingestions or analysis tasks can run in parallel.

*   **Maintainability Features:**
    *   **Microservices with Clear Boundaries:** Each service has a well-defined responsibility and interface, reducing complexity and facilitating independent development by small teams.
    *   **Clean/Layered Architecture:** Within services, separates domain logic from technical concerns, making code easier to understand, test, and modify.
    *   **Comprehensive Logging & Monitoring:** Centralized logging (ELK, Splunk) and monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana) provide visibility into system behavior, aid in debugging, and proactive issue detection.
    *   **Automated Testing:** Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for all services ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
    *   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Version-controlled infrastructure definitions ensure consistent and reproducible environments.
    *   **Clear Documentation:** API documentation, service contracts, and architectural diagrams ensure common understanding.
