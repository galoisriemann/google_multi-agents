## Requirements Analysis

The user requests a comprehensive LLM-guided Gartner-style market research report generating framework. This framework needs to be modular, scalable, and well-documented.

### Functional Requirements

*   **Industry Analysis and Competitive Landscape Mapping:**
    *   The framework shall be capable of analyzing specified industries to identify key players, market share, strengths, weaknesses, and strategic positions.
    *   It shall map the competitive landscape, including direct and indirect competitors, market challengers, and emerging threats.
*   **Market Trends Identification and Future Predictions:**
    *   The framework shall identify current and emerging market trends, including technological, economic, social, environmental, and political factors (PESTEL analysis implicitly).
    *   It shall generate future market predictions based on identified trends and historical data.
*   **Technology Adoption Analysis and Recommendations:**
    *   The framework shall analyze the adoption rates and impact of relevant technologies within specific industries.
    *   It shall provide strategic recommendations regarding technology adoption, investment, and integration for businesses.
*   **Strategic Insights and Actionable Recommendations:**
    *   The framework shall synthesize collected data and analysis to generate strategic insights relevant to the market and competitive environment.
    *   It shall provide clear, actionable recommendations tailored to specific business objectives or market segments.
*   **Executive Summary with Key Findings:**
    *   Each generated report shall include a concise executive summary highlighting the most critical findings, insights, and recommendations.
*   **LLM Guidance/Integration:**
    *   The core analysis, synthesis, and report generation capabilities shall be driven by Language Model Models (LLMs). This includes data processing, insight extraction, pattern identification, and textual report generation.
*   **Custom Report Generation:**
    *   Users shall be able to define specific research parameters (e.g., industry, competitor, market segment, specific metrics) to generate focused and customized market reports.
*   **Data Aggregation and Processing:**
    *   The framework shall aggregate data from diverse sources, including industry news, company reports, SEC filings, market databases, research papers, primary research sources (e.g., Nielsen, Kantar), and real-time social media signals.
    *   It shall process and analyze collected data to extract relevant information and identify correlations.
*   **Continuous Updates:**
    *   The system shall continuously monitor market developments and automatically incorporate new data to ensure reports are current.

### Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance requirements:**
    *   The framework should generate market research reports efficiently, with a focus on delivering insights in a timely manner, especially for "real-time world" scenarios (as hinted in `test_ppt.pptx`). Specific latency targets need to be defined during detailed design.
*   **Security requirements:**
    *   The system shall ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all processed data and generated reports.
    *   Robust access controls must be in place to protect sensitive business and market intelligence.
    *   Data at rest and in transit should be encrypted.
*   **Scalability requirements:**
    *   The framework must be designed to scale, accommodating an increasing volume of data sources, more complex analysis demands, and a growing number of report generation requests without significant performance degradation.
    *   It should support horizontal and vertical scaling of its computational and data storage resources.
*   **Usability requirements:**
    *   **Modularity:** The framework shall be modular, allowing for independent development, deployment, and maintenance of its components.
    *   **Documentation:** Comprehensive and detailed documentation for implementation (e.g., APIs, internal workings, setup guides) shall be provided, adhering to best practices like those outlined in `coding_standards.docx` (PEP 8, PEP 20, PEP 257).
    *   **User Interface (Implicit):** While not explicitly stated, an intuitive interface for users to specify report requirements would enhance usability.

### Technical Constraints

*   **Technology Stack Preferences:**
    *   The core of the framework must leverage Language Model Models (LLMs) for data analysis, synthesis, and report generation.
    *   Python is the preferred programming language for development, given the emphasis on Python coding standards (`coding_standards.docx`).
    *   The system should be capable of integrating with various data storage solutions for structured and unstructured data.
*   **Platform Constraints:**
    *   The framework should ideally be cloud-agnostic or at least deployable on common cloud platforms to ensure scalability and accessibility. (Assumption)
*   **Integration Requirements:**
    *   The system must integrate with external APIs and databases to pull data from diverse market intelligence sources (e.g., industry news APIs, SEC filing databases, social media APIs, proprietary market research databases).

### Assumptions and Clarifications

*   **Input Data Availability and Quality:** It is assumed that the system will have reliable and timely access to high-quality, relevant market data from various sources necessary for comprehensive analysis.
*   **LLM Capabilities:** It is assumed that the chosen LLMs are capable of performing complex analytical tasks, understanding nuanced market data, synthesizing information accurately, and generating coherent, factual, and insightful reports in a "Gartner-style" format, minimizing hallucinations and biases.
*   **"Gartner Style" Definition:** Clarification is needed on specific stylistic and content requirements implied by "Gartner style," beyond what is generally understood (e.g., specific report sections, depth of analysis, visual elements).
*   **User Interaction Model:** Clarification on how users will interact with the framework to request and customize reports (e.g., web interface, API calls, natural language prompts).
*   **Report Output Format:** What are the expected output formats for the generated reports (e.g., PDF, Word, structured data for dashboards)?

### Risk Assessment

*   **Potential Technical Risks:**
    *   **Data Ingestion and Integration Complexity:** Integrating with a wide variety of disparate data sources (structured, unstructured, real-time) can be complex and prone to errors or data quality issues.
    *   **LLM Accuracy and Reliability:** Over-reliance on LLMs could lead to "hallucinations," biased outputs, or misinterpretation of complex market dynamics, leading to inaccurate reports.
    *   **Scalability Challenges:** Ensuring the LLM inferencing, data processing, and storage can scale efficiently to meet growing demand and data volumes.
    *   **Data Security and Privacy:** Handling potentially sensitive market and business data requires robust security measures to prevent breaches and ensure compliance.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Phased Data Integration:** Implement data source integration in phases, starting with critical sources and gradually expanding. Utilize robust ETL/ELT pipelines with data validation.
    *   **Hybrid AI Approach & Human Oversight:** Combine LLM capabilities with traditional analytical models (e.g., statistical analysis, econometric models) and implement a human-in-the-loop review process for critical report sections and insights to validate LLM outputs. Employ prompt engineering and fine-tuning for LLMs.
    *   **Cloud-Native Architecture & Microservices:** Design the framework using a cloud-native, microservices-based architecture to enable independent scaling of components. Utilize managed services offered by cloud providers for LLM inference, data storage, and processing.
    *   **Robust Security-by-Design:** Implement security from the initial design phase, including strong encryption, access controls (RBAC), regular security audits, and adherence to relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
    *   **Performance Monitoring:** Implement comprehensive monitoring and logging to identify performance bottlenecks and proactively address them.
