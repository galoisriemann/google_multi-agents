### Design Patterns

#### Architectural Patterns

*   **Microservices Architecture:** Decomposes the system into small, independent, and loosely coupled services.
*   **Event-Driven Architecture:** Services communicate asynchronously via events, enabling loose coupling, scalability, and resilience.
*   **Data Lakehouse:** Combines the flexibility of a data lake with the structure of a data warehouse, providing a single source of truth for raw and processed data.
*   **Serverless (Optional for specific components):** For event-driven processing of data ingestion or minor utility functions (e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure Functions) to optimize cost and operational overhead for infrequent tasks.

#### Design Patterns for Implementation

*   **Repository Pattern:** Abstracts data access logic from business logic for easier testing and maintainability.
*   **Service Layer Pattern:** Defines a clear boundary between the presentation layer (UI/API) and the business logic layer within each microservice.
*   **Builder Pattern:** Used in `Report Generation Service` to construct complex report objects step-by-step.
*   **Strategy Pattern:** For interchangeable algorithms, e.g., different analytical models in the `Analysis & Insights Engine` or different prompt engineering strategies in the `LLM Orchestration Service`.
*   **Observer Pattern:** For continuous updates, allowing services to react to changes in data or external market events.
*   **Circuit Breaker Pattern:** To prevent cascading failures when external APIs or dependent services are unavailable (e.g., in `Data Ingestion Services` when calling external APIs).
*   **Command Pattern:** Encapsulating report generation requests as objects, allowing for queueing, logging, and undoable operations.
*   **Decorator Pattern:** For adding functionality to LLM prompts or data transformation steps (e.g., adding security filters, performance logging).
*   **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):** Potentially for `Request Management` and `Report Storage` services to optimize read and write operations if throughput demands become very high.
*   **Saga Pattern:** To manage distributed transactions and maintain data consistency across multiple services for complex workflows like report generation.

### Quality Attributes

#### Scalability

*   **Microservices:** Each service can be scaled independently based on its specific load requirements. Services can be deployed with multiple instances behind load balancers.
*   **Containerization (Docker) & Orchestration (Kubernetes):** Enables horizontal scaling by automatically adding/removing container instances based on CPU, memory, or custom metrics.
*   **Asynchronous Communication (Kafka):** Decouples services, allowing producers and consumers to operate at different paces and absorb bursts of activity.
*   **Cloud-Native Services:** Leveraging managed cloud services (e.g., S3, RDS, EKS, Serverless Functions) provides inherent scalability and reduces operational burden.
*   **Stateless Services:** Most services are designed to be stateless to facilitate easy horizontal scaling. State is externalized to databases or message queues.
*   **Data Sharding/Partitioning:** For databases, data can be sharded or partitioned to distribute load and improve query performance.
*   **LLM Scaling:** Use of managed LLM services (e.g., Azure OpenAI) or auto-scaling clusters for self-hosted models. Batching LLM requests where possible.

#### Security Considerations

*   **Authentication & Authorization:**
    *   **API Gateway:** Enforces authentication (e.g., OAuth 2.0, JWT) and role-based access control (RBAC) for all incoming requests.
    *   **Service-to-Service Communication:** Mutual TLS (mTLS) for secure communication between microservices within the cluster.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Each service runs with the minimum necessary permissions to perform its function.
*   **Data Encryption:**
    *   **Data at Rest:** All data stored in databases, object storage, and disk volumes will be encrypted using industry-standard algorithms (e.g., AES-256).
    *   **Data in Transit:** All network communication (internal and external) will use TLS/SSL.
*   **Input Validation & Sanitization:** Strict validation of all inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., prompt injection for LLMs, SQL injection for databases).
*   **Secrets Management:** Use dedicated secrets management services (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault) for API keys, database credentials, and other sensitive information.
*   **LLM Safety & Guardrails:** Implement content moderation, output filtering, and prompt engineering best practices to mitigate risks of biased, toxic, or hallucinated LLM outputs. Human-in-the-loop validation for critical insights.
*   **Regular Security Audits & Penetration Testing:** Periodically assess the system for vulnerabilities.
*   **Compliance:** Design with data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA) in mind, especially concerning data retention and user consent.

#### Performance Optimizations

*   **Asynchronous Processing:** Long-running tasks (data ingestion, LLM inference, report generation) are handled asynchronously via message queues, ensuring the UI remains responsive.
*   **Caching:** Implement caching at the API Gateway level and within services (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data or LLM responses.
*   **Optimized Data Storage:** Choosing appropriate databases for different data types (e.g., vector DB for RAG, graph DB for relationships, columnar DB for analytics) optimizes query performance.
*   **Parallel Processing:** `Data Ingestion` and `LLM Orchestration` can process multiple data sources or LLM sub-queries in parallel.
*   **Efficient LLM Prompting:** Advanced prompt engineering, few-shot learning, and RAG techniques to reduce LLM token usage and improve inference time while maintaining accuracy.
*   **Resource Allocation:** Dynamically adjust compute resources (CPU, GPU) for LLM-intensive tasks.
*   **Batch Processing:** Grouping data for LLM inference or data transformations to reduce overhead.

#### Maintainability Features
