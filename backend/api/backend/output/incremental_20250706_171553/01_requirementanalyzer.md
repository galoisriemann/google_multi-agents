- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** The platform should implement RBAC to manage user permissions and access to agents, data, and functionalities.
- **Reporting and Analytics:** Provide dashboards and tools to analyze agent performance, task completion rates, and the value generated by the agents.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance Requirements:**
    - Agents should respond to tasks within defined service level objectives (SLOs), with typical response times measured in milliseconds for simple queries and seconds/minutes for complex analytical tasks.
    - The platform must support concurrent execution of a high number of agents without significant performance degradation.
    - Data processing throughput should be scalable to handle large volumes of incoming data efficiently.
- **Security Requirements:**
    - Data at rest and in transit must be encrypted.
    - Robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for users and agents.
    - Agents should operate within secure, isolated environments to prevent unauthorized access or data breaches.
    - Adherence to industry-standard security protocols and regular security audits.
    - Implement strong data privacy controls to comply with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), especially if sensitive data is processed.
- **Scalability Requirements:**
    - The platform must be horizontally and vertically scalable to accommodate an increasing number of agents, users, data volume, and computational load.
    - It should support dynamic allocation of resources based on demand.
- **Usability Requirements:**
    - Intuitive and user-friendly interface for agent creation, management, and monitoring.
    - Clear documentation, tutorials, and examples for users.
    - Ease of integration with existing systems and data sources.
- **Maintainability Requirements:**
    - The codebase must adhere to good coding practices, including clear and concise code, proper naming conventions (as suggested in `coding_standards.docx` Table 1), and comprehensive documentation (PEP 257 for docstrings, READMEs).
    - The project structure should be organized logically (as suggested in `coding_standards.docx` Table 2).
    - Automated testing should be implemented to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
- **Reliability Requirements:**
    - High availability of the platform and agents (e.g., 99.9% uptime).
    - Robust error handling and fault tolerance mechanisms.
    - Data backup and recovery procedures.

### Technical Constraints
- **Technology Stack Preferences:**
    - *Clarification Needed:* The preferred programming languages, frameworks, and database technologies. Given the context of "agentic AI" and `coding_standards.docx`, Python is likely a strong candidate, but specific frameworks (e.g., for AI, web services, data processing) need to be identified.
    - Cloud platform preference (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) or on-premise deployment.
- **Platform Constraints:**
    - Compatibility with existing IT infrastructure.
    - Specific operating system requirements for deployment environments.
- **Integration Requirements:**
    - APIs or SDKs for integrating with external data sources, third-party services, and downstream systems.
    - Support for standard data exchange formats (e.g., JSON, XML, Parquet).

### Assumptions and Clarifications
- **Assumptions Made:**
    - "Agentic AI" refers primarily to AI entities capable of autonomous decision-making, task execution, and interaction with environments and other agents, potentially leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) or other advanced AI models.
    - The platform will primarily serve developers and data scientists who want to build, deploy, and manage these agents, but also potentially business users who interact with the agents' outputs.
    - The platform will manage computational resources for running agents, either on dedicated infrastructure or via cloud services.
    - Adherence to `coding_standards.docx` best practices for code quality, documentation, and project organization is expected for the development of the platform itself.
    - Version control (Git) will be used for collaborative development, and virtual environments will be used to manage dependencies.
- **Questions that Need Clarification:**
    - What specific types of "agentic AI" are envisioned (e.g., LLM-based agents, traditional expert systems, robotic process automation (RPA) agents)?
    - What are the primary use cases or business problems this platform aims to solve with agentic AI?
    - Who are the primary end-users of the platform (e.g., AI developers, business analysts, data scientists, non-technical business users)?
    - What is the expected scale of agents and data (e.g., tens, hundreds, thousands of agents; gigabytes, terabytes, petabytes of data)?
    - What are the specific requirements for data sources and sinks? Are there existing systems that must be integrated?
    - What is the preferred deployment model (e.g., SaaS, on-premise, hybrid cloud)?
    - Are there any specific compliance or regulatory requirements that the platform needs to adhere to?
    - What is the budget and timeline for this project?

### Risk Assessment
- **Potential Technical Risks:**
    - **Complexity of Agent Orchestration:** Managing the dependencies, communication, and workflows of multiple autonomous agents can be highly complex, leading to unforeseen errors or performance bottlenecks.
    - **Scalability Challenges:** Ensuring the platform can efficiently scale to handle a growing number of agents and increasing data volumes without significant performance degradation or cost overruns.
    - **Security Vulnerabilities:** Agents interacting with diverse data sources and potentially external systems introduce significant attack surfaces. Ensuring secure isolation and data handling is critical.
    - **Integration with Diverse AI Models:** Integrating and standardizing interactions with various underlying AI models (e.g., different LLMs, custom machine learning models) can be challenging.
    - **Resource Management:** Efficiently allocating and managing computational resources (CPU, GPU, memory) for diverse agent workloads.
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Modular Architecture:** Design the platform with a highly modular and loosely coupled architecture to manage complexity and allow for independent development and scaling of components.
    - **Load Testing and Performance Benchmarking:** Conduct extensive load testing and performance benchmarking early in the development cycle to identify and address scalability issues.
    - **Zero-Trust Security Model:** Implement a zero-trust security model, stringent access controls, regular security audits, and secure coding practices for all components. Use sandboxed environments for agent execution.
    - **Standardized Agent Interface:** Define a clear and standardized API or interface for agents, allowing for flexibility in underlying AI model implementation while maintaining platform compatibility.
    - **Containerization and Orchestration:** Utilize containerization (e.g., Docker) and container orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes) for efficient resource allocation, deployment, and scaling.
    - **Phased Rollout:** Implement the platform in phases, starting with core functionalities and a limited set of agent types, gradually adding more complex features and expanding capabilities based on user feedback and identified needs.
    - **Comprehensive Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement robust monitoring and alerting systems to proactively identify and address performance bottlenecks, security incidents, or agent failures.
