    *   The framework shall automatically generate a concise executive summary highlighting the most critical findings, insights, and recommendations from the comprehensive report.
*   **LLM-Guided Processing and Generation:**
    *   The framework shall utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) at various stages, including data analysis, insight extraction, pattern identification, and custom report generation.
*   **Custom Report Generation:**
    *   The framework shall allow users to specify research requirements (e.g., industry, competitor, market segment, specific metrics) to generate focused, relevant reports.
    *   The framework shall produce a structured and professional "Gartner-style" market research report.
*   **Continuous Updates:**
    *   The framework shall continuously monitor market developments and automatically incorporate new data to keep reports current with real-time industry changes.

### Non-Functional Requirements
*   **Performance requirements:**
    *   The report generation process should be efficient, aiming for timely delivery of insights to support critical decision-making.
    *   Data processing and LLM inference should be optimized for speed.
*   **Security requirements:**
    *   All data handling, storage, and processing must comply with relevant data privacy and security standards.
    *   Access to sensitive market data and generated reports should be controlled and authenticated.
*   **Scalability requirements:**
    *   The framework must be modular and designed to scale horizontally to accommodate increasing volumes of data sources, analytical requests, and simultaneous users.
    *   Components should be loosely coupled to allow for independent scaling.
*   **Usability requirements:**
    *   The interface for specifying research requirements should be intuitive and user-friendly.
    *   Generated reports should be clear, well-structured, and easy to understand for business users and executives.
*   **Modularity:**
    *   The framework shall be built with a modular architecture, where each core function (data collection, analysis, personalization, report generation, continuous updates) is a distinct, independent module.
*   **Detailed Documentation:**
    *   Comprehensive documentation for implementation, usage, and maintenance shall be provided, adhering to Python Enhancement Protocols (PEP 257 for docstrings) and external style guides (e.g., Google's Python Style Guide).

### Technical Constraints
*   **Technology stack preferences:**
    *   Python is the preferred language, adhering to PEP 8 for coding style and other best practices.
    *   Integration with various data sources (APIs, databases, web scraping tools for news, reports, social media).
    *   Leveraging LLM APIs or self-hosted LLM instances.
*   **Platform constraints:**
    *   Deployment environment should support scalable data processing and LLM inference.
    *   Consideration for cloud-native deployment (e.g., for elastic scalability and managed services).
*   **Integration requirements:**
    *   Ability to integrate with external data providers and APIs (e.g., financial data services, social media platforms).
    *   Potential integration with business intelligence (BI) tools for visualization or further analysis.
*   **Development Standards:**
    *   Adherence to good coding practices, including version control (Git), use of virtual environments, and a well-organized project structure (e.g., `source`, `scripts`, `docs`, `tests` directories).
    *   Utilize type hints for improved code readability and maintainability (PEP 484).
    *   Inclusion of a project test suite for quality assurance.
    *   Documentation to include a `README.md` and `requirements.txt` file.

### Assumptions and Clarifications
*   **"Gartner style" report:** It is assumed this implies a high-quality, data-driven report with a clear structure, in-depth analysis, strategic insights, and actionable recommendations, similar to reports from leading market research firms. Specific formatting or visual guidelines would require further clarification.
*   **LLM Access and Capabilities:** It is assumed that suitable LLMs are available and accessible, capable of performing the required text analysis, synthesis, and generation tasks with sufficient accuracy and relevance.
*   **Data Source Access:** It is assumed that necessary legal and technical access to the wide array of mentioned data sources (SEC filings, market databases, primary research, social media) is feasible and within budget.
*   **User Input Mechanism:** It is assumed that the mechanism for users to "specify research requirements" will be structured (e.g., via an API, a web form with predefined fields, or a structured natural language input parser) rather than purely free-form natural language for initial scope.
*   **Definition of "Real-Time":** Clarification is needed on the exact latency requirements for "real-time" updates (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly).

### Risk Assessment
*   **Potential technical risks:**
    *   **LLM Hallucination and Bias:** LLMs may generate factually incorrect information or exhibit biases present in their training data, leading to inaccurate market insights.
        *   **Mitigation:** Implement robust validation and fact-checking mechanisms, human-in-the-loop review for critical insights, and prompt engineering techniques to reduce bias. Ground LLM outputs with verifiable data.
    *   **Data Quality and Completeness:** The accuracy of the reports heavily relies on the quality, completeness, and timeliness of ingested data. Poor data can lead to flawed analysis.
        *   **Mitigation:** Implement strong data validation, cleansing, and reconciliation processes. Diversify data sources to cross-reference information.
    *   **Scalability Challenges:** Processing and analyzing vast amounts of real-time data with LLMs can be computationally intensive and expensive, posing scalability challenges.
        *   **Mitigation:** Design a microservices-based architecture, leverage cloud computing resources for elastic scaling, optimize data processing pipelines, and implement efficient caching strategies.
    *   **Integration Complexity:** Integrating with a multitude of diverse and potentially proprietary data sources can be complex and prone to breaking changes.
        *   **Mitigation:** Use standardized APIs where possible, develop robust error handling and retry mechanisms for integrations, and maintain clear documentation for each data source.
*   **Mitigation strategies:**
    *   **Iterative Development:** Adopt an agile approach, delivering core functionalities first and iteratively refining the framework based on feedback and performance metrics.
    *   **Robust Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error logging and handling across all modules, especially for data ingestion and LLM interactions.
    *   **Performance Monitoring:** Implement monitoring tools to track system performance, data pipeline health, and LLM response times.
    *   **Security by Design:** Embed security considerations from the initial design phase, including data encryption, access controls, and regular security audits.
    *   **Documentation and Training:** Provide thorough documentation and training for users and developers to ensure proper understanding and utilization of the framework.
