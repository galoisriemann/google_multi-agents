# LLM-Guided Gartner-Style Market Research Report Generating Framework

## Overview
This framework provides a modular, scalable, and LLM-guided solution for generating comprehensive Gartner-style market research reports. It automates key aspects of market analysis, including industry and competitive landscape mapping, market trend identification, technology adoption assessment, and the generation of strategic insights and actionable recommendations. By leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and a microservices architecture, the framework aims to deliver timely, data-driven insights to support critical business decision-making.

**Key Features:**
*   **Industry Analysis & Competitive Landscape:** Ingests diverse data (news, reports, social media) to map key players, perform SWOT analysis, and identify disruptive forces.
*   **Market Trends & Future Predictions:** Analyzes historical and real-time market data to identify trends, patterns, and make future predictions using LLM insights.
*   **Technology Adoption Analysis:** Assesses current technology adoption and emerging technologies, providing strategic recommendations.
*   **Strategic Insights & Actionable Recommendations:** Synthesizes findings from all analyses to generate tailored strategic insights and customer-specific action items.
*   **Executive Summary:** Automatically generates a concise executive summary with critical findings and recommendations.
*   **LLM-Guided Processing:** Utilizes LLMs for data analysis, insight extraction, pattern identification, and report generation.
*   **Custom Report Generation:** Allows users to specify research requirements for focused, relevant report generation.
*   **Continuous Updates (Framework Ready):** Designed to continuously monitor market developments and incorporate new data for up-to-date reports.

## Installation

To set up and run this market research report generation framework:

1.  **Clone the Repository (or create the project structure manually):**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-link>
    cd project/
    ```
    If creating manually, ensure the `src/`, `tests/` directories and their contents match the structure provided in the `Developer Guide`.

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
    *   **On macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    *   **On Windows:**
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    First, create a `requirements.txt` file in the root of your `project/` directory with the following content:
    ```
    pydantic==2.5.2
    # aiohttp # For real async HTTP requests if mocking is removed
    # python-dotenv # For loading environment variables securely
    # Other potential dependencies for a real system (mocked in this framework):
    # fastapi
    # uvicorn
    # requests
    # google-generativeai
    # openai
    # apache-kafka-python (or confluent-kafka)
    # celery
    # redis
    # psycopg2-binary (for PostgreSQL)
    # neo4j
    # pinecone-client (or weaviate-client, qdrant-client)
    # pandas
    # scrapy (or beautifulsoup4, selenium)
    ```
    Then install them:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Quick Start

Navigate to the `src` directory and run the `main.py` script:
```bash
cd src
python main.py
```
This will execute the example report generation and continuous update simulation, printing the generated report's executive summary and key sections to the console.

### 6. LLM-Guided Processing and Generation
*   The framework deeply integrates Large Language Models (`LLMOrchestrator`) at various stages for data analysis, insight extraction, pattern identification, and custom report generation, abstracting different LLM providers.

### 7. Custom Report Generation
*   The `ResearchRequest` model allows users to specify research requirements (e.g., industry, competitor, market segment) to generate focused, relevant reports.
*   The `ReportGenerationService` compiles and formats the analysis into a structured report (Pydantic model representing a "Gartner-style" output).

### 8. Continuous Updates (Framework Readiness)
*   The `continuous_update_cycle` method simulates the capability for continuous monitoring of market developments and automatic incorporation of new data to keep reports current. In a production system, this would involve a robust scheduler and event-driven architecture.

# Initialize the framework
framework = ReportGeneratorFramework()

# Define an example Research Request
example_request_data = {
    "industry": "Cloud Computing",
    "target_market_segment": "SME",
    "specific_metrics": ["growth_rate", "customer_acquisition_cost"],
    "competitors_of_interest": ["AWS", "Microsoft Azure", "Google Cloud"]
}

# Generate the report asynchronously
async def run_example():
    print("\n--- Generating Initial Report ---")
    report = await framework.generate_report(example_request_data)

    if report:
        print("\n--- Executive Summary ---")
        print(report.executive_summary.summary)
        print("\n--- Key Findings ---")
        for finding in report.executive_summary.key_findings:
            print(f"- {finding.title}: {finding.description}")
        print("\n--- Actionable Recommendations ---")
        for rec in report.strategic_recommendations.actionable_recommendations:
            print(f"- {rec.recommendation}: {rec.details}")
        print("\n--- Full Report Content (Partial) ---")
        print(f"Industry Analysis Overview: {report.industry_analysis.overview[:100]}...")
        print(f"Market Trends Overview: {report.market_trends.overview[:100]}...")
        print(f"Technology Adoption Overview: {report.technology_adoption.overview[:100]}...")

    print("\n--- Simulating Continuous Update ---")
    await framework.continuous_update_cycle()
