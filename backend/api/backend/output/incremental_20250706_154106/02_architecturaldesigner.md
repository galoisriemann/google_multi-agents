## System Architecture Design

### High-Level Architecture

The LLM-guided market research report generation framework will adopt a **Microservices Architecture** combined with an **Event-Driven Architecture**. This approach promotes modularity, scalability, independent development, and resilience, which are crucial for handling diverse data sources, complex LLM interactions, and real-time processing requirements.

**Overall System Design and Components:**

1.  **Client/User Interface (UI):** Provides an intuitive interface for users to define report scope (industry, competitor, market segment), trigger report generation, and view generated reports.
2.  **API Gateway:** Acts as the single entry point for all client requests, handling routing, authentication, and rate limiting.
3.  **Orchestration Service:** The central brain of the system, managing the end-to-end workflow of report generation, coordinating calls between various microservices, and tracking report status.
4.  **Data Ingestion & Curation Service:** Responsible for connecting to diverse external data sources (news, company reports, market databases, social media, primary research) and internal data sources (customer interactions, sales trends). It performs data collection, initial validation, cleansing, and normalization.
5.  **LLM Orchestrator Service:** Manages all interactions with Large Language Models. It handles prompt engineering, context window management, model selection, and potentially fine-tuning. It acts as an abstraction layer for various LLM providers.
6.  **Analysis & Synthesis Service:** Leverages LLMs (via the LLM Orchestrator) to process curated data. It performs core analytical tasks like extracting key insights, identifying market patterns, analyzing correlations, competitive landscape mapping, trend identification, and future predictions. This service might comprise multiple specialized LLM-powered agents.
7.  **Personalization Service:** Integrates with internal customer data (interactions, sales, marketing outreach) to derive and tailor strategic insights and actionable recommendations specific to the user's context.
8.  **Report Generation Service:** Assembles the final market research report from the outputs of the Analysis & Synthesis Service, Personalization Service, and Orchestration Service. It applies "Gartner-style" formatting, structure, and tone.
9.  **Continuous Monitoring Service:** Periodically (or event-driven) triggers data updates and re-analysis based on predefined schedules or detection of significant market changes (e.g., through real-time news feeds).
10. **Data Storage Layer:** A collection of specialized databases for different data types.
11. **Authentication & Authorization Service:** Manages user authentication and access control for the entire system and specific report content.
12. **Messaging/Event Bus:** Facilitates asynchronous communication and decoupling between microservices (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ).

*   **LLM Orchestrator Service:**
    *   **Responsibility:** Abstract LLM provider complexity. Manage prompt templates, context windows, API keys, model selection (e.g., GPT-4 for synthesis, a smaller model for entity extraction). Implement retry mechanisms and rate limiting for LLM calls. Potentially integrate RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) by interacting with a Vector Database.
    *   **Interface/Contracts:** Internal REST/gRPC API for LLM interaction (e.g., `POST /generate-text`, `POST /analyze-data`). Takes structured input (data, context, instructions) and returns LLM output.
*   **Analysis & Synthesis Service:**
    *   **Responsibility:** Process curated data using LLMs to extract insights, identify patterns, perform competitive analysis, market trend identification, technology adoption analysis. This service will contain the sophisticated prompt engineering logic specific to "Gartner-style" analysis.
    *   **Interface/Contracts:** Subscribes to `data_ingested` events. Makes calls to the LLM Orchestrator. Publishes `analysis_complete` events with structured analytical outputs (e.g., identified trends, SWOT elements, market predictions).
*   **Personalization Service:**
    *   **Responsibility:** Access internal customer data (sales, interactions, marketing) to derive context-specific strategic insights and highly personalized actionable recommendations.
    *   **Interface/Contracts:** Internal API to request personalized insights for a given customer/context. Consumes relevant internal data streams/APIs.
*   **Report Generation Service:**
    *   **Responsibility:** Combine structured outputs from Analysis & Synthesis and Personalization services. Apply templating and formatting rules to generate the final report in desired formats (PDF, DOCX, Markdown). Ensure "Gartner-style" tone, structure, and visuals.
    *   **Interface/Contracts:** Subscribes to `analysis_complete` and potentially `personalization_complete` events. Accepts report structure/template parameters. Provides internal API to retrieve generated reports.
*   **Continuous Monitoring Service:**
    *   **Responsibility:** Continuously monitor selected external data sources (e.g., real-time news, social media). Detect significant changes or new data. Trigger re-ingestion or re-analysis workflows for affected reports.
    *   **Interface/Contracts:** Subscribes to new data streams. Publishes `market_change_detected` events or directly signals the Orchestration Service for updates.
*   **Authentication & Authorization Service:**
    *   **Responsibility:** User management, authentication (e.g., OAuth2, JWT token generation/validation), role-based access control (RBAC) for reports and functionalities.
    *   **Interface/Contracts:** RESTful API for login, registration, token validation. Integrated with API Gateway and other services for token validation.
*   **Data Storage Layer:**
    *   **Responsibility:** Store raw ingested data, curated/processed data, LLM interaction logs, generated reports, user metadata, and system configuration.
    *   **Interfaces:** Standard database drivers/ORMs.

**Data Flow Between Components:**

1.  **User Request:** Client sends a `report_request` (e.g., industry: "AI Software", scope: "Competitive Landscape") to the API Gateway.
2.  **Authentication & Routing:** API Gateway authenticates the user and routes the request to the Orchestration Service.
3.  **Orchestration & Data Ingestion:** Orchestration Service initiates the workflow. It signals the Data Ingestion & Curation Service to gather relevant data based on the report scope.
4.  **Data Collection:** Data Ingestion & Curation Service fetches data from External and Internal Data Sources, processes it, and stores it in the Data Lake. It then publishes a `data_ingested` event to the Message Bus.
5.  **Analysis Trigger:** The Analysis & Synthesis Service subscribes to `data_ingested` events. Upon receiving, it retrieves the curated data.
6.  **LLM Processing:** Analysis & Synthesis Service makes multiple calls to the LLM Orchestrator Service, providing data snippets and carefully engineered prompts to perform specific analyses (e.g., SWOT, trend identification). The LLM Orchestrator interacts with various LLM Providers.
7.  **Analysis Completion:** Once analyses are complete, the Analysis & Synthesis Service stores the structured insights in the Data Lake and publishes an `analysis_complete` event.
8.  **Personalization (Concurrent/Sequential):** The Orchestration Service may also trigger the Personalization Service to generate specific customer-centric recommendations using internal data. It publishes `personalization_complete` event.
9.  **Report Assembly:** The Report Generation Service subscribes to `analysis_complete` (and `personalization_complete`) events. It retrieves all relevant insights from the Data Lake and uses pre-defined templates and styling rules to compile the final report.
10. **Report Delivery:** The generated report is stored in the Generated Reports Storage, and a notification is sent back to the Orchestration Service, which then updates the report status for the UI. The user can then retrieve the report via the API Gateway.
11. **Continuous Monitoring:** The Continuous Monitoring Service constantly observes data sources. If new relevant data is detected, it triggers the Data Ingestion & Curation Service, which may lead to re-triggering the entire analysis and report generation process for affected reports.

    *   **Clean Architecture (or Hexagonal Architecture):** Applied within each microservice to separate concerns (domain logic, application services, infrastructure details). This ensures testability and maintainability.
*   **Design Patterns for Implementation:**
    *   **Command Pattern:** For encapsulating report generation requests or specific data processing tasks within the Orchestration Service.
    *   **Strategy Pattern:** For defining interchangeable algorithms for data analysis (e.g., different competitive analysis models) or LLM models within the Analysis & Synthesis Service.
    *   **Repository Pattern:** To abstract data access logic within each service, making it independent of the specific database technology.
    *   **Builder Pattern:** For constructing complex objects like LLM prompts or report sections, ensuring consistent construction.
    *   **Observer Pattern:** Key for the Continuous Monitoring Service to observe data changes and notify relevant services.
    *   **Circuit Breaker:** To prevent cascading failures in microservice interactions, especially with external LLM APIs or data sources.
    *   **Saga Pattern:** (Potentially) For managing distributed transactions across multiple services in the Orchestration Service, ensuring data consistency.
    *   **Factory Method/Abstract Factory:** For creating different types of data connectors in the Data Ingestion & Curation Service, or different report output formats in the Report Generation Service.
