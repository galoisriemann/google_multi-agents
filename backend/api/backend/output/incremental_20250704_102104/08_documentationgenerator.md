# LLM-Guided Gartner-Style Market Research Report Framework

## Overview
This framework provides a comprehensive, modular, and scalable solution for generating Gartner-style market research reports using Large Language Models (LLMs). It automates the process of industry analysis, competitive landscape mapping, market trend identification, technology adoption analysis, and the generation of strategic insights and actionable recommendations, culminating in a concise executive summary. Designed with a microservices architecture in mind, it emphasizes modularity, performance through asynchronous operations, and a strong foundation for future enhancements like real-time data ingestion and rich report rendering.

## Installation
To set up and run the framework locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd project
    ```

2.  **Create a Python virtual environment:**
    It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    The project relies on `pydantic` for data modeling, `pydantic-settings` for configuration, `python-dotenv` for environment variables, `aiohttp` for asynchronous HTTP requests (essential for real LLM APIs), and `Jinja2` for prompt templating.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root `project/` directory with the necessary configurations.
    **Note:** For real LLM integration, replace `"your_actual_llm_api_key"` with your actual API key. For testing with the `MockLLMClient`, it can be left as is or explicitly set to `None`.
    ```dotenv
    # .env
    LLM_API_KEY="your_actual_llm_api_key_if_using_real_llm"
    LLM_MODEL_NAME="gpt-4o-mini" # Example: "gemini-pro" or "gpt-4o"
    LOG_LEVEL="INFO"
    ```

## Quick Start
Once installed and configured, you can run the main script to generate a sample market research report.

```bash
# From the root 'project/' directory
python src/main.py
```

This will execute the `generate_market_research_report` function with a predefined sample request and print the formatted report content to your console. Logs will be generated in the `logs/` directory.

## Examples

### Generating a Report
The `src/main.py` script provides an example of how to use the core `generate_market_research_report` function.

```python
import asyncio
from src.main import generate_market_research_report
from src.modules.data_models import ReportRequest

async def run_example():
    sample_request = ReportRequest(
        industry="Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare",
        scope="Global market size, key players, and emerging trends for AI diagnostics.",
        competitors=["Google Health", "IBM Watson Health", "Babylon Health"],
        target_audience="Healthcare Investors and Technology Strategists"
    )

    report = await generate_market_research_report(sample_request)

    if report:
        print("\n--- Generated Market Research Report ---")
        print(report.formatted_content)
    else:
        print("\n--- Report generation failed. Check logs for details. ---")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(run_example())
```
This example showcases how to define a `ReportRequest` and then asynchronously trigger the report generation process, receiving the `MarketResearchReport` object upon completion.
```

### User Guide
```markdown
# User Guide

This guide provides instructions for interacting with and utilizing the LLM-Guided Gartner-Style Market Research Report Framework.

## Getting Started

Currently, the framework operates primarily through its Python API. To generate a report, you will interact with the `generate_market_research_report` function in `src/main.py` (or through an API endpoint in a deployed system).

1.  **Define Your Research Request:**
    The core input for report generation is the `ReportRequest` object. You need to specify the following key parameters:
    *   `industry` (string, required): The main industry or sector you want to research (e.g., "Quantum Computing", "Sustainable Agriculture").
    *   `scope` (string, required): A detailed description of what aspects of the market you want to cover (e.g., "Market adoption and future impact of quantum algorithms in finance.", "Impact of climate change on crop yields and mitigation strategies.").
    *   `competitors` (list of strings, optional): Specific key players or companies you want the report to focus on for competitive analysis (e.g., `["Company A", "Company B"]`). Leave empty if not applicable.
    *   `target_audience` (string, required): Who is the report for? (e.g., "Tech Executives", "Investment Bankers", "Product Managers"). This helps the LLM tailor the tone and focus of the strategic insights and recommendations.
    *   `additional_notes` (string, optional): Any other specific instructions or areas of focus you want the LLM to consider.

    **Example `ReportRequest`:**
    ```python
    from src.modules.data_models import ReportRequest

    my_request = ReportRequest(
        industry="Autonomous Vehicles",
        scope="Regulatory landscape, adoption challenges, and investment opportunities in Level 4/5 autonomy.",
        competitors=["Waymo", "Cruise Automation", "Argo AI"],
        target_audience="Automotive Investors and Policy Makers",
        additional_notes="Focus heavily on the ethical implications of AI in self-driving cars."
    )
    ```

2.  **Trigger Report Generation:**
    Once your `ReportRequest` is defined, you can call the `generate_market_research_report` function. As this is an asynchronous function, it must be `await`ed within an `asyncio` event loop.

    ```python
    import asyncio
    from src.main import generate_market_research_report
    from src.modules.data_models import ReportRequest

    async def main_runner():
        my_request = ReportRequest(
            industry="Renewable Energy",
            scope="Global offshore wind market dynamics and technological advancements.",
            competitors=["Ørsted", "Siemens Gamesa", "Vestas"],
            target_audience="Energy Sector Stakeholders"
        )
        report = await generate_market_research_report(my_request)

        if report:
            print(report.formatted_content)
        else:
            print("Report generation failed.")

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        asyncio.run(main_runner())
    ```
    The generated report will be printed to your console. In a production system, this output would typically be saved to a file (PDF, Word) or displayed in a web interface.

## Advanced Usage

*   **Customizing LLM Models:**
    The `LLM_MODEL_NAME` in your `.env` file (`src/modules/config.py`) dictates which LLM model the framework will conceptually use. For actual LLM integrations (e.g., with OpenAI or Google Gemini), this setting would directly control the model accessed via their APIs.
*   **Integrating Real Data Sources (Future):**
    While the `DataProcessor` currently uses mock data, the architecture is designed to integrate with diverse real-world data sources (industry news, financial reports, social media, proprietary databases). Future versions or custom implementations would involve configuring these data pipelines within the `DataProcessor` module.
*   **Extending Report Sections (Developer-level):**
    The modular design allows for adding new analytical sections to the report by extending the `LLMOrchestrator` to generate additional insights and updating the `ReportFormatter` to include these new sections. This might involve creating new prompt templates in `src/prompts/`.

## Best Practices

*   **Be Specific with `scope`:** The more detailed and clear your `scope` is, the better the LLM can focus its analysis and provide relevant insights.
*   **Identify Key Competitors:** Providing a list of key competitors helps the LLM to perform more targeted competitive landscape mapping.
*   **Set Realistic Expectations:** While LLMs are powerful, the quality of the report heavily depends on the quality and breadth of the underlying data (currently mocked, but critical for real-world use) and the prompt engineering. Complex or highly niche topics might require more refined input or human post-editing.
*   **Review Generated Reports:** Always review the generated report for accuracy, coherence, and adherence to your specific requirements. LLM outputs can sometimes contain inaccuracies or "hallucinations."
*   **Monitor Logs:** Pay attention to the console output and the `logs/app.log` file for any warnings or errors during report generation.

## Troubleshooting

*   **"LLM_API_KEY is not configured" error:**
    *   **Cause:** The `LLM_API_KEY` environment variable is either not set in your `.env` file or is empty.
    *   **Solution:** Ensure you have a `.env` file in the `project/` root directory and it contains `LLM_API_KEY="your_actual_llm_api_key"` (or any string value if using the `MockLLMClient` for testing without a real key).
*   **"Failed to process market data." error:**
    *   **Cause:** The `DataProcessor` encountered an issue. In the current mock implementation, this would likely be due to a simulated internal error. In a real system, it would indicate issues with data ingestion, external API calls, or data cleaning.
    *   **Solution:** Check the logs (console and `logs/app.log`) for detailed error messages. For the mock, this indicates an unexpected internal state. For a real system, inspect the data sources and ingestion pipelines.
*   **"Failed to generate market insights using LLM." or similar LLM-related errors:**
    *   **Cause:** The `LLMOrchestrator` failed to get a meaningful response from the LLM. This could be due to issues with the LLM API (e.g., rate limits, invalid API key, service outage), a malformed prompt, or the LLM struggling to understand the request or generate content.
    *   **Solution:**
        *   Verify your `LLM_API_KEY` is correct and active.
        *   Check the LLM provider's status page.
        *   Review the `scope` and `industry` in your `ReportRequest` for clarity and conciseness. Very long or ambiguous requests can confuse the LLM.
        *   Check `logs/app.log` for `LLMGenerationError` details.
*   **Report content seems generic or incomplete:**
    *   **Cause:** The input `scope` or `additional_notes` might not be specific enough, or the LLM's understanding of the context is limited (especially with mock data).
    *   **Solution:** Refine your `ReportRequest` parameters to be more precise. In a real system, improving the `DataProcessor`'s ability to provide richer, more relevant context to the LLM (via RAG) would be key.
*   **ModuleNotFoundError:**
    *   **Cause:** Python cannot find the necessary modules. This usually means dependencies are not installed or the virtual environment is not activated.
    *   **Solution:** Ensure your virtual environment is activated (`source venv/bin/activate`) and all dependencies are installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`). Also, ensure you are running the script from the `project/` root directory.

6.  **Unit Tests:** Write comprehensive unit tests for new or modified functionality. Ensure existing tests pass. Test filenames should follow `test_*.py` convention.
7.  **Asynchronous Code:** When dealing with I/O-bound operations (especially external API calls like LLMs), favor Python's `asyncio` for non-blocking operations and concurrent execution. Ensure `async def` and `await` are used correctly.
8.  **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling using the custom exceptions defined in `src/modules/exceptions.py`. Log errors appropriately with `logging.error(..., exc_info=True)`.
9.  **Security:** Be mindful of security implications. Sanitize all user inputs before passing them to LLMs or using them in data processing. Validate and sanitize LLM outputs. Avoid hardcoding sensitive information.
10. **Modularity:** Maintain the modular design. Each module should have a single responsibility.

## Testing Instructions

The project uses Python's built-in `unittest` framework.

1.  **Activate your virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

2.  **Run all unit tests:**
    From the root `project/` directory:
    ```bash
    python -m unittest discover tests
    ```

This command will discover and run all test files within the `tests/` directory.

**Note on Asynchronous Tests:**
Tests interacting with `async` functions (e.g., `test_data_processor.py`, `test_llm_orchestrator.py`, `test_main.py`) now inherit from `unittest.IsolatedAsyncioTestCase` and their test methods are `async`. When patching `async` functions, ensure your mocks return `awaitable` objects (e.g., `MagicMock` typically handles this, or use `unittest.mock.AsyncMock`).

## Deployment Guide

The framework is designed for a microservices deployment, ideally on a cloud-agnostic platform using containerization.

1.  **Containerization (Docker):**
    Each microservice (or logical module in this consolidated codebase) can be containerized using Docker. A `Dockerfile` would define the environment, dependencies, and entry point for each service.

2.  **Orchestration (Kubernetes):**
    For managing and scaling multiple microservice containers, Kubernetes is the recommended orchestration platform. Kubernetes can handle:
    *   **Deployment:** Defining how services are deployed (e.g., number of replicas).
    *   **Scaling:** Automatically scaling services up or down based on load (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler).
    *   **Load Balancing:** Distributing incoming requests across service instances.
    *   **Service Discovery:** Allowing services to find and communicate with each other.
    *   **Health Checks:** Monitoring service health and restarting failed containers.

3.  **CI/CD Pipeline:**
    Implement Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) using tools like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, or Jenkins. A typical pipeline would involve:
    *   **Linting & Static Analysis:** Running `flake8`, `black`, `bandit` (for security) on code changes.
    *   **Unit Tests:** Executing the comprehensive test suite.
    *   **Container Image Building:** Building Docker images for updated services.
    *   **Image Scanning:** Scanning container images for vulnerabilities.
    *   **Deployment:** Automatically deploying new versions to staging and then production environments upon successful checks.

4.  **Message Broker (e.g., Apache Kafka):**
    In a full microservices setup, an event bus (like Apache Kafka) would be crucial for asynchronous communication between services. This decouples components and enables resilient, scalable event-driven workflows (e.g., a `ReportRequested` event triggering data ingestion, which in turn triggers LLM analysis).

5.  **Data Stores:**
    *   **Data Lake:** Utilize cloud object storage (AWS S3, GCP Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage) for raw and processed data.
    *   **Vector Database:** Integrate a vector database (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus, ChromaDB) for efficient RAG, storing LLM embeddings.
    *   **Relational/NoSQL DB:** Use PostgreSQL or a suitable NoSQL database for structured metadata, user data, and summarized insights.

6.  **Secrets Management:**
    For production, migrate from `.env` files to a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Google Cloud Secret Manager, HashiCorp Vault) to securely store and access sensitive credentials like LLM API keys and database passwords.

7.  **Monitoring & Observability:**
    Implement centralized logging (e.g., ELK Stack, cloud-native logging), metrics (Prometheus + Grafana), and tracing (OpenTelemetry) to monitor system health, performance, and quickly diagnose issues in a distributed environment.

### Quality and Security Notes
```markdown
# Quality and Security Report

This section summarizes the quality, security, and performance characteristics of the LLM-Guided Gartner-Style Market Research Report Framework, based on thorough reviews.

## Code Quality Summary

The codebase exhibits a high level of quality, demonstrating a strong adherence to modern Python best practices, modular design, and testability.

**Strengths:**
*   **Exceptional Modularity and Structure:** Well-organized into distinct `src/modules` (e.g., `data_models`, `data_processor`, `llm_orchestrator`), aligning with microservices and clean architecture principles.
*   **Strong Adherence to SOLID Principles:** Evident in Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) for classes and Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) through `AbstractLLMClient`.
*   **Comprehensive Data Modeling:** Robust use of Pydantic models ensures data validation, clear schemas, and type safety.
*   **Effective Error Handling:** Custom exceptions and graceful `try-except` blocks prevent unhandled crashes and provide clear error context (now with `exc_info=True` for custom errors).
*   **Robust Logging Implementation:** Centralized, configurable logging to file and console.
*   **High Testability and Coverage:** Comprehensive unit tests with effective mocking (using `unittest.mock.patch` and `unittest.IsolatedAsyncioTestCase` for async).
*   **Clear Configuration Management:** `pydantic-settings` with `.env` support for settings, now with `extra='forbid'` for stricter validation.
*   **Documentation and Readability:** Consistent PEP 257 docstrings, inline comments, and an informative `README.md`.
*   **Asynchronous Operations:** Refactored LLM calls to be asynchronous using `asyncio.gather`, significantly improving performance.
*   **Externalized LLM Prompts:** Prompts are now in Jinja2 templates, separating concerns and improving flexibility.

**Areas for Improvement (and addressed conceptually/partially):**
*   **Real RAG Implementation:** The RAG concept is articulated but requires a full implementation with vector databases and embedding generation.
*   **More Sophisticated Mocking:** Current mocks are basic; more elaborate mocks would enhance testing realism.
*   **Rich Report Output:** The `ReportFormatter` currently outputs a plain string; integration with dedicated document generation libraries (PDF, Word) is a future step for true "Gartner-style" visuals.

## Security Assessment

The framework demonstrates foundational security awareness, but as a prototype, it has critical areas requiring attention for production deployment.

**Critical Issues (requiring immediate attention in real implementation):**
*   **LLM Prompt Injection Vulnerability:** Conceptual input sanitization (`_sanitize_input`) is introduced, but a robust solution for user-controlled inputs in prompts is vital. Malicious inputs could manipulate LLM behavior or extract sensitive data.
*   **Unaddressed Data Ingestion Security:** The `DataProcessor` is mocked. In a real system, secure data ingestion from diverse, potentially untrusted sources is a major attack surface for SSRF, RCE, and data integrity issues. Comments in `DataProcessor` highlight these risks.

**Medium Priority Issues (addressed conceptually/partially):**
*   **Lack of Robust LLM Output Validation and Sanitization:** Basic output sanitization (`_validate_and_sanitize_llm_output`) is introduced. If reports are rendered in a web browser, thorough HTML escaping is needed to prevent XSS.
*   **Sensitive Data Exposure to External LLM Services:** The design implies sending `ProcessedData` to external LLMs. Comments now emphasize anonymization/pseudonymization of sensitive data before external transmission.
*   **Generic Exception Handling in `main.py` for Custom Errors:** Addressed by logging `exc_info=True` for `ReportGenerationError`.

**Low Priority Issues (addressed/improved):**
*   **Development-Grade Secrets Management:** `LLM_API_KEY` now defaults to `None`, with a warning, nudging towards production-grade secrets management.
*   **Pydantic `extra='ignore'` Configuration:** Changed to `extra='forbid'` in `config.py` for stricter environment variable handling.

**Security Best Practices Followed:**
*   Modular Architecture for isolated security controls.
*   Pydantic for data schema validation.
*   Environment variables for basic configuration (though upgraded for production).
*   Structured logging for security events.
*   Custom exception handling for clarity.
*   Mocking external services in tests for isolation.

## Performance Characteristics

The architectural design is strong for scalability and performance, but the initial code implementation had critical synchronous bottlenecks. These have been significantly addressed.

**Critical Performance Issues (original, now largely mitigated):**
*   **Synchronous LLM Calls (Major Bottleneck):** **ADDRESSED.** `LLMOrchestrator` now performs multiple independent LLM API calls concurrently using `asyncio.gather`, dramatically reducing total report generation time from sequential sum to parallel maximum.
*   **Unaccounted Data Processing Latency:** The `DataProcessor` is still a mock but is now `async` to reflect real-world I/O operations. This conceptual change sets the stage for implementing efficient, asynchronous, and potentially distributed data processing pipelines (streaming, batching) in the future.

**Optimization Opportunities (future considerations):**
*   **LLM Request Batching:** Investigate if the chosen LLM provider API supports batching multiple prompts for further efficiency.
*   **Caching for LLM Responses:** A dedicated caching layer (e.g., Redis) would prevent re-computation for common queries.
*   **Optimized Real Data Processing:** Implementing distributed frameworks (Spark, Dask) and efficient RAG retrieval is crucial when the `DataProcessor` moves beyond mock data.
*   **LLM Model Selection & Prompt Engineering:** Continued prompt optimization and selection of appropriate LLM sizes for tasks.

**Scalability Assessment:**
The underlying **Microservices Architecture with an Event-Driven Backbone** (as per the architectural design) is inherently designed for high scalability (horizontal scaling, handling large data volumes, accommodating report demand). The refactoring to `asyncio` for LLM orchestration significantly enhances the throughput capacity of the `LLM Orchestration & Analysis Service`, making the overall system more responsive and scalable.

## Known Limitations

*   **Mocked Data Sources:** The `DataProcessor` module currently uses hardcoded mock data. A real-world application would require robust integrations with diverse external data sources (APIs, databases, web scraping).
*   **Conceptual RAG Implementation:** While the architecture design highlights Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), the current code provides a conceptual placeholder. A full RAG implementation would involve a vector database and sophisticated embedding/retrieval mechanisms.
*   **Plain Text Report Output:** The `ReportFormatter` currently generates a plain Markdown-like string. True "Gartner-style" reports often require rich formatting, charts, and diagrams, necessitating integration with dedicated document generation libraries (e.g., ReportLab for PDF, `python-docx` for Word, or HTML-to-PDF converters).
*   **No User Interface (UI) / API Gateway:** The framework's entry point is currently a Python function call. A production system would typically expose a RESTful API (via a framework like FastAPI) and/or a user-friendly web interface.
*   **Limited Production Security Hardening:** While security considerations have been addressed conceptually and with basic implementations (e.g., input/output sanitization, environment variables), a production system would require much more rigorous security measures, including comprehensive input validation, secrets management, and secure deployment practices.
*   **No Persistent Storage for Reports:** Generated reports are currently only printed to console. A real system would save them to object storage or a database for retrieval and archival.

*   **Enhanced Security Posture:**
    *   Introduced conceptual input sanitization (`_sanitize_input`) and LLM output validation (`_validate_and_sanitize_llm_output`) to mitigate prompt injection and output manipulation risks.
    *   Improved sensitive API key handling in `src/modules/config.py` (defaults to `None`, warns if missing).
    *   Updated Pydantic `model_config` to `extra='forbid'` for stricter environment variable handling.
    *   Added explicit comments on critical security considerations for real data ingestion (SSRF, RCE prevention) and LLM data handling (anonymization).
*   **Improved Error Handling & Logging:** All custom `ReportGenerationError` exceptions in `main.py` now log with `exc_info=True`, providing full stack traces for better debugging.
*   **Mock Enhancements and Real-World Considerations:** `DataProcessor` and `MockLLMClient` include more explicit comments on how real implementations would address performance, security, and scalability.

*   **Updated Dependencies:** `requirements.txt` now includes `aiohttp` and `Jinja2`.
*   **Comprehensive Unit Tests:** All existing unit tests updated to support `asyncio` and new functionalities.

## Breaking Changes

This release introduces several breaking changes due to the shift to asynchronous programming and changes in configuration management and prompt handling.

*   **Synchronous to Asynchronous Transformation:**
    *   The primary `generate_market_research_report` function in `src/main.py` is now an `async` function. Any code that calls it must be updated to `await` its execution within an `asyncio` event loop (e.g., `asyncio.run(generate_market_research_report(...))`).
    *   Similarly, all methods within `LLMOrchestrator` that interact with the LLM client, and the `AbstractLLMClient` and `MockLLMClient`'s `generate_text` method, are now `async` and require `await` calls.
*   **LLM Prompt Location and Usage:**
    *   LLM prompt content is no longer hardcoded strings in `llm_orchestrator.py`. Instead, it is externalized into Jinja2 template files within the new `src/prompts/` directory.
    *   If you were previously modifying prompts directly in Python code, you now need to edit the corresponding `.j2` template files.
*   **LLM_API_KEY Configuration:**
    *   The `LLM_API_KEY` in `src/modules/config.py` now defaults to `None`. If you were implicitly relying on a placeholder value, you must now explicitly set `LLM_API_KEY` in your `.env` file, or the system will raise a warning/error (for real LLM usage, it will be a critical error).
*   **Pydantic `extra` Setting for Config:**
    *   The `model_config` in `src/modules/config.py` has changed from `extra='ignore'` to `extra='forbid'`. This means any environment variables present in your `.env` file that are *not* explicitly defined as fields in the `Settings` class will now cause an error. Review your `.env` file and `Settings` class to ensure alignment.

## Migration Guides

To migrate your environment and code to Version 1.0.0, follow these steps:

1.  **Update Dependencies:**
    *   Open your `requirements.txt` file and ensure it includes the new dependencies:
        ```
        pydantic>=2.0
        pydantic-settings>=2.0
        python-dotenv>=1.0
        aiohttp>=3.9
        Jinja2>=3.1
        ```
    *   Then, install them:
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

2.  **Adjust Code for Asynchronous Operations:**
    *   **Main Application Entry Point:**
        Modify your main execution block (e.g., in `src/main.py` or any custom script that calls `generate_market_research_report`) to run the asynchronous function:
        ```python
        import asyncio
        # ... other imports
        
        async def main_run_logic():
            # Your ReportRequest creation here
            report = await generate_market_research_report(your_report_request)
            # ... handle report
            
        if __name__ == "__main__":
            asyncio.run(main_run_logic())
        ```
    *   **LLM Orchestrator Calls:**
        If you have custom orchestration logic that directly calls methods of `LLMOrchestrator` (e.g., `generate_market_insights`, `generate_executive_summary`), ensure these calls are now `await`ed.
        ```python
        # Before (synchronous):
        # insights = llm_orchestrator.generate_market_insights(...)
        
        # After (asynchronous):
        insights = await llm_orchestrator.generate_market_insights(...)
        ```
    *   **LLM Client Calls:**
        If you have custom LLM client implementations or direct calls, ensure the `generate_text` method is `async` and `await`ed.

3.  **Create Prompt Templates:**
    *   Create a new directory structure: `project/src/prompts/`.
    *   Move your LLM prompt content into separate `.j2` (Jinja2 template) files within this `prompts/` directory. For example, create `industry_analysis.j2`, `competitive_landscape.j2`, etc., corresponding to the templates used in `llm_orchestrator.py`. Refer to the `src/prompts` section in the Code Implementation for examples.
    *   The `LLMOrchestrator` now loads these templates using `jinja_env.get_template("template_name.j2")`.

4.  **Review `.env` Configuration:**
    *   Ensure your `.env` file at the `project/` root has `LLM_API_KEY` explicitly set if you intend to use a real LLM provider.
    *   Verify that only the environment variables defined in `src/modules/config.py`'s `Settings` class are present in your `.env` if you want to avoid errors from `extra='forbid'`.

5.  **Update Unit Tests:**
    *   For any test file (`tests/test_*.py`) that tests `async` functions, change the test class inheritance from `unittest.TestCase` to `unittest.IsolatedAsyncioTestCase`.
    *   Mark all asynchronous test methods within these classes as `async def`.
    *   Ensure that any mock objects representing `async` functions return awaitable values (e.g., by using `new_callable=MagicMock` when patching, which makes mock methods awaitable).

By following these steps, your environment and code will be compatible with Version 1.0.0 of the framework, allowing you to leverage its enhanced performance and maintainability features.
