### Non-Functional Requirements
*   **Performance requirements:**
    *   **Report Generation Speed:** Reports should be generated within an acceptable timeframe, considering the complexity and data volume. (Specific metrics to be defined during design).
    *   **Data Processing Latency:** Real-time data ingestion and processing should have minimal latency to ensure current insights.
*   **Security requirements:**
    *   **Data Confidentiality:** All collected and generated data, especially sensitive market intelligence, must be protected against unauthorized access.
    *   **Data Integrity:** Mechanisms must be in place to ensure the accuracy and trustworthiness of the data.
    *   **Access Control:** Robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for user access to the framework and generated reports.
*   **Scalability requirements:**
    *   **Data Volume:** The framework must be able to handle ever-increasing volumes of input data from various sources.
    *   **Report Demand:** The system should scale to accommodate a growing number of report generation requests without significant degradation in performance.
    *   **Modular Architecture:** The design should be modular to allow independent scaling of individual components (e.g., data collection, LLM processing, report rendering).
*   **Usability requirements:**
    *   **User Interface (Implicit):** While not explicitly requested, a user-friendly interface for specifying research requirements and accessing reports would enhance usability.
    *   **Report Readability:** Generated reports should be clear, concise, and easy to understand for business users, adhering to professional standards (e.g., Gartner style).
*   **Maintainability:** The framework should be designed for ease of maintenance, updates, and bug fixes, with a focus on code readability and structure, as highlighted in `coding_standards.docx`.
*   **Documentation:** Comprehensive and detailed documentation for implementation, usage, and maintenance is required, following best practices (e.g., PEP 257 for docstrings, README files, project organization as per `coding_standards.docx`).

### Technical Constraints
*   **Technology Stack Preferences:**
    *   **LLM Integration:** The framework's core must be built around integrating and leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). The specific LLM (e.g., OpenAI, Google Gemini, open-source models) is open for discussion.
    *   **Python Ecosystem:** Given the strong emphasis on Python best practices in `coding_standards.docx` (PEP 8, PEP 20, PEP 257, type hints), Python is the preferred language for implementation.
    *   **Version Control:** Git is a mandatory version control system for project collaboration and code management.
    *   **Virtual Environments:** Use of virtual environments (e.g., `venv`, `conda`) is required to manage project dependencies.
*   **Platform Constraints:**
    *   **Cloud Agnostic (Preferred):** While not explicitly stated, a cloud-agnostic design would offer flexibility, though specific cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure) may be considered for compute and storage.
*   **Integration Requirements:**
    *   **Diverse Data Source Integration:** The framework must integrate with various APIs and data formats (e.g., news feeds, financial databases, social media APIs, internal customer data systems) for data ingestion.
    *   **API-First Design (Implicit):** Components should ideally expose APIs for inter-module communication and potential external integrations.

### Assumptions and Clarifications
*   **Specific LLM Choice:** It is assumed that a suitable LLM will be chosen (or developed/fine-tuned) that can handle the complexity of market analysis and report generation. Clarification is needed on whether the LLM choice is open or if there are specific preferences/constraints.
*   **Report Output Format:** What is the desired output format for the generated reports (e.g., PDF, Word document, web-based interactive report, structured JSON/XML)?
*   **Definition of "Gartner Style":** While implied, a clearer definition of "Gartner style" (e.g., specific sections, depth of analysis, visual presentation standards, tone) is needed.
*   **Human-in-the-Loop:** Is there an expectation for human oversight or intervention in the report generation process (e.g., review of LLM outputs, fact-checking, final editing)? Or is this intended to be a fully automated system?
*   **Data Access and Licensing:** It is assumed that necessary access and licenses for premium market databases (e.g., Nielsen, Kantar, SEC filings, specific news APIs) will be available.
*   **Personalization Scope:** Clarification is needed on the initial scope of "Personalisation" (customer interactions, sales trends, marketing outreach) for the first iteration. Is this a future phase or part of the initial release?

### Risk Assessment
*   **Potential Technical Risks:**
    *   **LLM Hallucinations and Inaccuracies:** LLMs can generate factually incorrect or nonsensical information, which could severely compromise report credibility.
    *   **Data Quality and Completeness:** Inaccurate, incomplete, or biased input data will lead to flawed analysis and insights.
    *   **Computational Cost of LLMs:** Running and scaling LLMs, especially for complex analytical tasks, can be prohibitively expensive and resource-intensive.
    *   **Integration Complexity:** Integrating with a wide variety of external data sources, each with its own API and data format, can be challenging.
    *   **Bias in LLM Outputs:** LLMs can inherit biases from their training data, potentially leading to skewed market insights or recommendations.
    *   **Maintaining Real-Time Data Flow:** Ensuring continuous, real-time aggregation and processing of diverse and rapidly changing market data is technically demanding.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **For LLM Hallucinations:** Implement robust fact-checking mechanisms, integrate Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to ground LLM responses with verified data, enforce strict human review cycles for critical sections of the report.
    *   **For Data Quality:** Implement data validation, cleansing, and enrichment pipelines. Prioritize reputable and verified data sources. Establish clear data governance policies.
    *   **For Computational Cost:** Optimize LLM prompts, explore smaller or fine-tuned models, leverage cloud-native services with cost optimization, consider batch processing where real-time isn't critical.
    *   **For Integration Complexity:** Use a standardized data ingestion layer, leverage existing ETL tools or data integration platforms, design for extensibility to easily add new data sources.
    *   **For Bias in LLM Outputs:** Implement fairness and bias detection metrics for LLM outputs. Diversify data sources to reduce inherent biases. Regular auditing of generated reports for potential biases.
    *   **For Real-Time Data Flow:** Utilize streaming data architectures (e.g., Kafka, Pub/Sub), implement robust error handling and monitoring for data pipelines, leverage automated data refresh schedules.
    *   **Intellectual Property/Confidentiality:** Implement strict data encryption (at rest and in transit), robust access controls, secure cloud infrastructure, and clear legal frameworks regarding data ownership and usage.
