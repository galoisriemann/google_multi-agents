Allows flexible addition of new strategies without modifying core logic.\n    *   **Observer Pattern**: For the continuous market monitoring (F9), where Data Ingestion Service acts as a subject publishing `DataIngested` events, and other services (Data Processing, LLM Orchestration) act as observers.\n    *   **Factory Method / Abstract Factory**: For dynamic creation of data connectors, LLM clients, or report renderers based on configuration.\n    *   **Circuit Breaker**: To prevent cascading failures when external services (e.g., LLM APIs, data source APIs) are unavailable or slow, enhancing system resilience.\n    *   **Retry Pattern**: For handling transient failures in network calls or external service interactions, improving robustness.\n    *   **Command Pattern**: For encapsulating requests as objects, allowing for parameterization of clients with different requests, queuing, or logging of requests. Useful in the Request Orchestrator.\n\n### Quality Attributes\n\n*   **Scalability (NFR3.1, NFR3.2, R4 Mitigation)**:\n    *   **Microservices & Containerization**: Allows independent horizontal scaling of individual services (e.g., Data Ingestion service can scale independently of LLM Orchestration). Docker containers deployed on Kubernetes enable elastic scaling based on demand.\n    *   **Asynchronous Communication**: Message brokers (Kafka/SQS) decouple producers from consumers, buffering spikes in load and enabling services to process data at their own pace.\n    *   **Stateless Services**: Most services are designed to be stateless, simplifying horizontal scaling by adding more instances behind load balancers.\n    *   **Cloud-Native Services**: Leveraging managed cloud services (S3, RDS, managed message brokers) provides built-in scalability and reduced operational overhead.\n    *   **Elasticsearch (if used)**: Scalable search and analytics for logs and processed data.\n*   **Security (NFR2.1, NFR2.2)**:\n    *   **Data Encryption**: All data will be encrypted at rest (in S3, databases) and in transit (TLS/SSL for all inter-service and external communication).\n    *   **Access Control**: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) will govern user access to the UI and specific report types. Internal service-to-service communication will use secure methods (e.g., mTLS).\n    *   **Secrets Management**: API keys for LLMs and external data sources will be securely stored and managed using a dedicated secrets manager (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault).\n    *   **Data Privacy**: Pseudonymization or anonymization of sensitive market intelligence data where applicable. Adherence to data governance policies.\n    *   **Network Security**: Services deployed within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with granular security groups and network ACLs to restrict unauthorized access.\n    *   **LLM Security**: Input/output sanitization to prevent prompt injection attacks and protect against data leakage through LLM interactions.\n*   **Performance Optimizations (NFR1.1, NFR1.2, R3 Mitigation)**:\n    *   **Asynchronous & Parallel Processing**: Data ingestion and processing pipelines will leverage message queues and parallel execution to handle large volumes of structured and unstructured data efficiently. LLM calls, being IO-bound, will also be asynchronous.\n    *   **Caching**: Redis will cache frequently accessed data, LLM responses, or pre-computed analytical insights to reduce redundant computations, LLM API calls (cost reduction), and improve response times.\n    *   **Optimized Data Storage**: Using specialized databases like Vector DB for semantic search (RAG) and columnar databases for analytical queries ensures efficient data retrieval.\n    *   **LLM Optimization**: Strategic prompt engineering, contextual chunking, and selective use of LLM calls (e.g., fine-tuning smaller models for specific tasks) to reduce latency and operational costs.\n*   **Maintainability Features (NFR5.1, NFR5.2, NFR5.3)**:\n    *   **Modularity (Microservices)**: Small, independent services are easier to understand, develop, test, and deploy in isolation, reducing complexity and maintenance burden.\n    *   **Clean Architecture**: Applying Clean Architecture principles within each service ensures clear separation of concerns, making the codebase highly testable and adaptable to changes.\n    *   **Comprehensive Documentation**: Adherence to Python coding standards (PEP 8, PEP 20, PEP 257) for consistent code style and well-defined docstrings. Detailed architectural documentation, API specifications (e.g., OpenAPI), and a clear project README (NFR5.2, NFR5.3).\n    *   **Automated Testing**: Robust suite of unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for all components to ensure code quality and prevent regressions during maintenance.\n    *   **Observability**: Centralized logging, metrics collection (Prometheus), and distributed tracing (e.g., OpenTelemetry) will provide deep insights into system behavior, facilitating rapid debugging and performance tuning.\n    *   **Idempotency**: Designing critical operations to be idempotent simplifies error handling and retry logic, contributing to system robustness.## Code Implementation\n\nThe following code implements the core components of the LLM-guided Gartner-style market research report generating framework, adhering to a microservices-oriented approach.

The adherence to microservice principles, use of modern Python features like Pydantic, and inclusion of a basic testing suite are commendable. However, as a simulated environment, certain critical complexities inherent to real-world distributed systems and LLM integrations are simplified, which impacts the maintainability and robustness in a production context.\n\n### Strengths\n*   **Modular Architecture:** The system is well-structured into distinct services (Ingestion, Processing, Analysis, LLM Orchestration, Report Generation) each with a clear Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). This microservices approach enhances scalability and maintainability.\n*   **Clear Data Models:** The use of `Pydantic` models for `ReportRequest`, `MarketAnalysisResults`, `ReportContentSections`, etc., provides strong typing, data validation, and improves code readability and maintainability significantly.\n*   **Simulated Event-Driven Design:** The `MessageBroker` class, though in-memory, effectively demonstrates the concept of asynchronous, decoupled communication between services, which is crucial for scalability and resilience in a distributed system.\n*   **Comprehensive Documentation & Setup:** The provided installation instructions, project structure, and inline docstrings (for classes and methods) are excellent, making the codebase understandable and easy to set up and run.\n*   **Logging Implementation:** A centralized logging setup (`utils.py`) is used consistently across modules, which is vital for monitoring and debugging.\n*   **Error Handling (Basic):** The introduction of `CustomError` and `try-except` blocks provides a basic layer of error handling, signaling potential issues in the workflow.\n*   **Testing Foundation:** The inclusion of representative unit tests using `unittest` and `MagicMock` demonstrates a commitment to testing, isolating components effectively for verification.\n\n### Areas for Improvement\n*   **True Asynchronous Processing:** While an event-driven architecture is described, the `MessageBroker`'s `_process_queue` directly calls handlers synchronously within the `publish` method. In a real microservices setup, consumers would run in separate processes/threads, consuming from a persistent queue, which isn't demonstrated. The `main.py` (orchestrator) also makes direct calls to service methods after publishing events, undermining the asynchronous nature.\n*   **LLM Orchestration Realism:** The `_call_llm_api` method is entirely hardcoded with dummy responses. This significantly oversimplifies LLM interactions, which in reality involve careful prompt engineering, handling API errors, rate limits, token management, cost optimization, and potential for \"hallucinations.\" The RAG implementation is also very basic (dummy embedding, simple retrieval).\n*   **Data Store Simulation Limitations:** All data stores (Data Lake, Data Warehouse, Vector Database, Cache, Metadata DB) are in-memory dictionaries. This means no data persistence, no concurrent access handling, and no actual database performance characteristics are demonstrated.\n*   **Error Handling Granularity:** While `CustomError` is present, many `try-except` blocks catch generic `Exception`. More specific exception types should be caught and handled where possible, allowing for more precise recovery or logging.\n*   **Test Coverage & Quality:**\n    *   The provided unit tests are good examples but are not comprehensive. Many methods, especially in `data_processing_service`, `market_analysis_service`, and `report_generation_service`, lack dedicated tests.\n    *   The `test_data_ingestion_failure` in `test_data_ingestion.py` attempts to mock `_fetch_from_api`, a method that does not exist in `DataIngestionService`, indicating a flaw in the test itself.\n    *   More tests for edge cases, invalid inputs, and integration points (even mocked ones) are needed.\n*   **Dependency Management (Orchestrator):** The `ReportOrchestrator` explicitly instantiates all services and their dependencies. While functional, for a larger system, a dependency injection container could simplify setup and improve testability by allowing dependencies to be swapped easily.\n*   **Configuration Management:** While `pydantic-settings` is used, the `.env` file for `LLM_API_KEY` etc. is not actually used by the mocked LLM calls. Real LLM integration would need this to be actively consumed.\n*   **Report Generation Complexity:** The `_assemble_report_content` and `generate_executive_summary` methods are simplistic string concatenations/extractions. \"Gartner-style\" reports imply rich formatting, charts, and often specific document formats (PDF, DOCX). This requires dedicated templating or document generation libraries.\n\n### Code Structure\n*   **Organization:** The `project/src/modules` structure is logical and adheres well to the microservices concept by separating concerns into distinct Python files. This is excellent for navigation and understanding.\n*   **Modularity:** Each service (`data_ingestion_service.py`, `market_analysis_service.py`, etc.) encapsulates its specific functionality, demonstrating good modularity.\n*   **Design Pattern Usage:**\n    *   **Microservices Architecture:** Well-applied conceptually, though the synchronous simulation limits its practical benefits in the demo.\n    *   **Event-Driven Architecture:** The `MessageBroker` and subscription mechanism clearly lay out this pattern.\n    *   **Repository Pattern (implicit):** The `DataLake`, `DataWarehouse`, `VectorDatabase` classes serve as repositories, abstracting away the underlying (simulated) data storage.\n    *   **Pydantic Models:** Effective use of Pydantic for defining data structures, enforcing schemas, and improving data consistency.\n\n### Documentation\n*   **Docstrings:** Most classes and public methods have clear and informative docstrings, explaining their purpose, arguments, and return values. This greatly enhances code readability and maintainability.\n*   **Inline Comments:** Comments are used appropriately to explain simulated components or complex logic (e.g., dummy LLM responses, simplified RAG).\n*   **README/Setup:** The provided installation and usage instructions are detailed and easy to follow, allowing anyone to set up and run the project.\n*   **Areas for Improvement:** Module-level docstrings are missing from some `src/modules/*.py` files. Adding these would provide a high-level overview of each module's purpose.\n\n### Testing\n*   **Coverage (Provided):** Unit tests are provided for `ReportOrchestrator`, `DataIngestionService`, and `LLMOrchestrationService`. This indicates an understanding of the importance of testing.\n*   **Quality:**\n    *   `unittest.mock.MagicMock` is used effectively to isolate units under test by mocking their dependencies.\n    *   Tests cover success paths and basic failure scenarios (e.g., service failing with `CustomError`).\n    *   Assertions are clear and specific.\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   **Completeness:** Critical modules like `DataProcessingService`, `MarketAnalysisService`, and `ReportGenerationService` (beyond the orchestrator's interaction) do not have dedicated unit test files provided.\n    *   **Error Case Testing:** While some failure scenarios are tested, more robust testing for edge cases, invalid inputs, and how the system gracefully (or not) handles errors from external (mocked) dependencies would be beneficial.\n    *   **Test Accuracy:** The specific issue in `test_data_ingestion.py` where a non-existent method (`_fetch_from_api`) is mocked needs correction. This indicates a minor oversight in test design.\n    *   **Integration Tests:** While the current setup is a simulation, in a real environment, integration tests covering the flow between services via the message broker would be critical.\n\n### Maintainability\n*   **Modularity:** The microservices design inherently promotes maintainability. Changes in one service are less likely to impact others.\n*   **Readability:** Good naming conventions, Pydantic models, and comprehensive docstrings make the code highly readable.\n*   **Technical Debt (Current):** The primary technical debt in this demo is the extensive use of in-memory simulations for external systems (LLMs, databases, message brokers). Transitioning to real implementations will require significant work on error handling, performance, concurrency, and API integrations.\n*   **Extensibility:**\n    *   Adding new LLM providers would primarily involve modifying `LLMOrchestrationService` (e.g., using a Strategy pattern for LLM clients).\n    *   Adding new data sources would extend `DataIngestionService` and potentially `DataProcessingService`.\n    *   Adding new report sections or output formats would require modification in `ReportGenerationService` and `LLMOrchestrationService`. A more explicit Strategy/Factory pattern for report rendering could make `ReportGenerationService` more extensible.\n*   **Dependencies:** The manual dependency injection in `ReportOrchestrator` is manageable for this size but could become cumbersome for larger projects.\n\n### Recommendations\n1.  **Transition to a Real Message Broker:** Implement a lightweight message queue (e.g., Celery with Redis/RabbitMQ backend for tasks, or directly use a cloud-native solution like AWS SQS/SNS, GCP Pub/Sub) to enable true asynchronous processing between services. This will enforce decoupling and allow independent scaling.\n2.  **Integrate with Actual LLM APIs:**\n    *   Replace the dummy `_call_llm_api` with calls to real LLM providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic) using their official client libraries.\n    *   Leverage LLM orchestration frameworks like **LangChain** or **LlamaIndex** to manage prompts, chain LLM calls, handle context windows, and implement robust RAG (chunking, indexing, retrieval).\n    *   Implement **Retry Logic** and **Circuit Breakers** for LLM API calls to handle transient failures and prevent cascading failures.\n3.  **Implement Persistent Data Stores:** Replace in-memory data store simulations with actual databases (e.g., PostgreSQL for Data Warehouse/Metadata, Redis for Cache, Pinecone/Weaviate/pgvector for Vector Database, AWS S3 for Data Lake).\n4.  **Enhance Error Handling:**\n    *   Introduce more specific custom exception types for different failure modes (e.g., `DataIngestionError`, `LLMGenerationError`, `ReportAssemblyError`).\n    *   Refine `try-except` blocks to catch specific exceptions first before a generic `Exception`.\n    *   Ensure error logs include all relevant context (e.g., input parameters that led to the error).\n5.  **Expand Test Coverage:**\n    *   Write comprehensive unit tests for `DataProcessingService`, `MarketAnalysisService`, and `ReportGenerationService`.\n    *   Correct the error in `test_data_ingestion.py` by mocking methods that actually exist.\n    *   Introduce **Integration Tests** to verify the flow between services, especially through the message broker, ensuring events are correctly published and consumed.\n    *   Add tests for negative scenarios and edge cases (e.g., empty input data, LLM returning no content, invalid report requests).\n6.  **Refactor Report Generation:**\n    *   Implement a **Strategy Pattern** for `ReportGenerationService` to easily support different output formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX, Markdown, interactive HTML). This would allow adding new formats without modifying existing code.\n    *   For \"Gartner-style\" formatting, explore document generation libraries (e.g., `python-docx` for Word, `ReportLab` for PDF) or templating engines (`Jinja2`) for more robust report assembly.\n    *   The executive summary generation could benefit from a dedicated LLM call with a summarization prompt.\n7.  **Consider a Dependency Injection Framework:** For larger applications, frameworks like `python-inject` or `dependency-injector` can manage service dependencies, making the `ReportOrchestrator` less coupled and more testable.\n8.  **Refine Logging Details:** Add more `debug` and `info` level logs within the core logic of each service, detailing data transformations, LLM prompt content, retrieved RAG results, etc. This enhances observability.## Performance Review Report\n\n### Performance Score: 4/10\n\nThis score reflects the current state of the provided code as a *demonstration* with in-memory data structures and mocked external calls. While the architectural *design* lays a good foundation for scalability and performance, the *current implementation* is not production-ready from a performance perspective and would fail under any real load or data volume. The score acknowledges the conceptual design but heavily weighs the current operational limitations.\n\n### Critical Performance Issues\n\n1.  **In-Memory Data Stores:** All data persistence (`DataLake`, `DataWarehouse`, `VectorDatabase`, `CacheStore`, `MetadataDatabase`) is implemented using in-memory Python dictionaries and lists.\n    *   **Bottleneck:** This is the single largest bottleneck and a showstopper for any real-world application. It limits scalability to the RAM of a single machine, offers no data persistence, and will lead to `MemoryError` or `KeyError` as soon as data volumes grow.\n    *   **Impact:** Violates NFR1.2 (efficiently handle large data), NFR3.1/NFR3.2 (scalability). Data loss on restart.\n\n2.  **Synchronous Execution in Orchestrator (`main.py`):** Despite the stated \"Event-Driven backbone\" in the architectural design and the presence of a `MessageBroker` module, the `ReportOrchestrator` directly calls the service handlers after publishing events.\n    *   **Bottleneck:** The entire report generation process in `generate_report` is blocking and sequential. This negates the benefits of asynchronous communication and microservices, preventing parallel processing of pipeline stages (e.g., data processing starting for a new report while a previous one is in LLM orchestration).\n    *   **Impact:** Directly violates NFR1.1 (timely reports, near real-time updates) and significantly hinders scalability (NFR3.2) by creating a single-threaded bottleneck for the entire workflow.\n\n3.  **Dummy LLM Calls and RAG Implementation:** The `_call_llm_api` method in `LLMOrchestrationService` returns hardcoded strings, and the `_perform_rag` method uses a dummy embedding generation and a naive linear search (`Euclidean distance` with O(N*D) complexity) in `VectorDatabase`.\n    *   **Bottleneck (Future):** In a real system, actual LLM API calls are inherently high-latency (network I/O bound) and expensive. The current RAG implementation is computationally trivial but a real embedding model and vector search would be highly CPU/GPU and memory intensive.\n    *   **Impact:** Once real LLMs and RAG are integrated, these will become significant latency and throughput bottlenecks if not properly managed, impacting NFR1.1.\n\n### Optimization Opportunities\n\n1.  **Replace In-Memory Data Stores with Persistent & Scalable Solutions:**\n    *   **`DataLake`**: Implement with cloud object storage (AWS S3, Azure Data Lake Storage, GCP Cloud Storage).\n    *   **`DataWarehouse`**: Use a managed relational database (AWS RDS PostgreSQL, Azure SQL Database, GCP Cloud SQL) or a data warehouse service (Snowflake, BigQuery).\n    *   **`VectorDatabase`**: Integrate with a dedicated vector database (Pinecone, Milvus, Weaviate, or `pgvector` for PostgreSQL).\n    *   **`CacheStore`**: Implement with an in-memory data store like Redis (managed Redis instances are available on cloud platforms).\n    *   **`MetadataDatabase`**: A small relational database like PostgreSQL.\n\n2.  **Implement True Asynchronous Processing:**\n    *   Refactor `ReportOrchestrator` to genuinely use `asyncio` and `await` for I/O-bound operations and interactions with the message broker.\n    *   Update `MessageBroker` to be truly asynchronous (e.g., using `aio_pika` for RabbitMQ, `aiokafka` for Kafka, or cloud-native async clients for SQS/SNS/Pub/Sub). Services should consume messages from queues in separate asynchronous tasks or processes.\n    *   Ensure all external API calls (e.g., real LLMs, data sources) use asynchronous HTTP clients (e.g., `httpx` with `async/await`).\n\n3.  **Optimize Data Processing Pipelines:**\n    *   **Embedding Generation:** Integrate a real, performant embedding model (e.g., from `HuggingFace Transformers` or commercial LLM providers). Consider offloading this to a dedicated microservice or leveraging GPU-enabled instances for faster processing if self-hosting.\n    *   **Vector Search:** Leverage the chosen vector database's optimized Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search algorithms instead of the current linear scan.\n    *   **Data Cleansing/Transformation:** For very large datasets, consider using distributed processing frameworks (e.g., Apache Spark, Dask) if Python's single-machine processing becomes a bottleneck.\n\n4.  **Strategic LLM Usage & Caching:**\n    *   **Granular Caching:** Implement caching for frequently requested LLM responses or analytical sub-results within the `LLMOrchestrationService` and `ReportGenerationService` to reduce redundant LLM calls and improve latency.\n    *   **Prompt Optimization:** Minimize token usage in prompts to reduce cost and latency.\n    *   **Batching LLM Calls:** If feasible, batch multiple independent LLM requests for parts of the report to optimize API call overhead.\n    *   **Model Selection:** Explore using smaller, fine-tuned models for specific sub-tasks (e.g., summarization, entity extraction) where a full-fledged large model might be overkill, reducing latency and cost.\n\n5.  **Robust Error Handling and Retry Mechanisms:**\n    *   Implement retry logic (e.g., using the `tenacity` library) for transient failures in network calls (LLM APIs, data source APIs, database connections).\n    *   Integrate Dead Letter Queues (DLQs) with the message broker for failed messages to prevent data loss and enable re-processing.\n\n### Algorithmic Analysis\n\n*   **Data Ingestion (`DataIngestionService`):**\n    *   **Time Complexity (Current):** O(1) as it's a mock that generates fixed data.\n    *   **Time Complexity (Real-world):** Highly dependent on external API response times and web scraping efficiency. Likely dominated by network I/O.\n    *   **Space Complexity:** O(D) where D is the size of the ingested data.\n\n*   **Data Processing (`DataProcessingService`):**\n    *   **`_cleanse_and_normalize`:** O(L) where L is the total length of text data. Involves string operations.\n    *   **`_generate_vector_embeddings`:**\n        *   **Time Complexity (Current):** O(S * E) where S is number of segments and E is the dummy embedding dimension (128). The sum operation for dummy embedding is O(segment_length). So, effectively O(S * avg_segment_length).\n        *   **Time Complexity (Real-world):** O(S * M_infer_time) where M_infer_time is the inference time of the embedding model. This is often the most CPU/GPU intensive part.\n    *   **Space Complexity:** O(L + S * E) for processed data and embeddings.\n\n*   **Market Analysis (`MarketAnalysisService`):**\n    *   **Time Complexity:** O(E) where E is the number of entities/data points processed. Primarily dictionary lookups and simple calculations. Efficient for structured data.\n    *   **Space Complexity:** O(E) for storing analysis results.\n\n*   **LLM Orchestration (`LLMOrchestrationService`):**\n    *   **`_call_llm_api`:**\n        *   **Time Complexity (Current):** O(1) for mocked response.\n        *   **Time Complexity (Real-world):** O(T_input + T_output) where T is tokens. Dominated by network latency and LLM inference time. This is often minutes for long generations.\n    *   **`_perform_rag`:**\n        *   **Query Embedding:** O(Q_len) for query length.\n        *   **Vector Retrieval (`retrieve_embeddings`):**\n            *   **Time Complexity (Current - naive):** O(N * D) where N is the number of embeddings for a `report_id`, D is the embedding dimension. This is very inefficient for large N.\n            *   **Time Complexity (Real-world - ANN):** O(log N) or better, depending on the ANN algorithm and index size.\n        *   **Space Complexity:** O(D) for query embedding, O(K * E) for top-K retrieved embeddings.\n\n*   **Report Generation (`ReportGenerationService`):**\n    *   **Time Complexity:** O(R_len) where R_len is the total length of the final report. Primarily string concatenation and basic string parsing for summary generation.\n    *   **Space Complexity:** O(R_len) to hold the report in memory.\n\n*   **Suggestions for better algorithms/data structures:**\n    *   Implement real ANN algorithms for vector search in `VectorDatabase` (or use an external vector DB service).\n    *   For `DataProcessingService`, consider using highly optimized NLP libraries (e.g., spaCy for entity recognition, NLTK for text segmentation) and pre-trained models for efficiency.\n\n### Resource Utilization\n\n*   **Memory Usage:**\n    *   **Current (Demo):** Minimal. All data is stored in-memory, but the example data sets are tiny. This will become a critical issue for real data.\n    *   **Real-world:** Will be significant for `DataLake` (disk), `DataWarehouse` (disk/RAM), and especially `VectorDatabase` (RAM/GPU memory for embeddings). Data processing services will need sufficient RAM for in-flight data.\n*   **CPU Utilization:**\n    *   **Current (Demo):** Low. The dummy operations are not CPU-intensive.\n    *   **Real-world:** Will be high during `DataProcessingService` (especially embedding generation, text parsing, entity extraction) and `LLMOrchestrationService` (vector search if self-hosted, prompt engineering logic). LLM API calls offload the heavy computation to the LLM provider.\n*   **I/O Operation Efficiency:**\n    *   **Current (Demo):** Very low I/O as operations are in-memory.\n    *   **Real-world:** Will be the dominant factor for performance.\n        *   **Network I/O:** High for `DataIngestionService` (external APIs, web scraping) and `LLMOrchestrationService` (LLM API calls). This is a primary source of latency.\n        *   **Disk I/O:** High for reading/writing to `DataLake`, `DataWarehouse`, and `VectorDatabase`. Optimizing queries and indexing will be crucial.\n\n### Scalability Assessment\n\n*   **How well the code will scale with increased load:**\n    *   **Currently (Demo):** Very poorly. It's a single-process, synchronous system with in-memory data. It will fail with increased data volume (memory limits) and increased concurrent requests (bottlenecked by sequential processing).\n    *   **Based on Architectural Design:** The chosen microservices and event-driven architecture (if truly implemented) provides an excellent foundation for horizontal scalability. Each service can be deployed and scaled independently using containers and orchestrators like Kubernetes.\n\n*   **Horizontal and vertical scaling considerations:**\n    *   **Horizontal Scaling (Preferred):**\n        *   **Services:** Each microservice (Data Ingestion, Data Processing, Market Analysis, LLM Orchestration, Report Generation) can be scaled horizontally by adding more instances behind load balancers.\n        *   **Message Broker:** A robust message broker (Kafka, SQS, Pub/Sub) is essential to handle high message throughput and distribute workload to scaled consumers.\n        *   **Databases:** Use managed, horizontally scalable cloud databases/data stores (e.g., sharded relational DBs, object storage, distributed vector DBs).\n    *   **Vertical Scaling:** Less desirable for long-term scalability but can provide quick performance boosts by allocating more CPU/RAM to individual service instances. This has diminishing returns and higher costs compared to horizontal scaling.\n\n*   **Key Scaling Challenges to Address:**\n    *   **State Management:** Services must be designed to be largely stateless to facilitate easy horizontal scaling. Shared state should reside in persistent, scalable data stores.\n    *   **LLM Rate Limits & Cost:** Scaling LLM usage means potentially hitting API rate limits and incurring significant costs. Strategies like caching, batching, and intelligent prompt management are vital.\n    *   **Data Pipeline Throughput:** Ensuring the data ingestion, processing, and embedding generation pipelines can keep up with incoming data volumes.\n    *   **Observability:** Robust monitoring and logging will be critical to identify and debug performance bottlenecks in a distributed, scaled environment.\n\n### Recommendations\n\n1.  **Fundamental Data Store Overhaul (Critical - Immediate Action):**\n    *   Replace all `src/modules/data_stores.py` in-memory implementations with proper, scalable, and persistent external data solutions. For instance:\n        *   `DataLake`: AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, GCP Cloud Storage.\n        *   `DataWarehouse`: PostgreSQL (RDS), Snowflake, BigQuery.\n        *   `VectorDatabase`: Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus, or `pgvector` with PostgreSQL.\n        *   `CacheStore`: Redis.\n        *   `MetadataDatabase`: PostgreSQL.\n\n2.  **True Asynchronous Workflow (Critical):**\n    *   Refactor `src/main.py` (`ReportOrchestrator`) to use Python's `asyncio` for non-blocking I/O and interaction with an actual asynchronous message broker client (e.g., `aiokafka`, `aio_pika`).\n    *   Modify service methods (e.g., `process_ingested_data`, `handle_analytical_insights`) to be `async` functions that truly consume from the message broker rather than being directly called synchronously. This will enable concurrent processing of multiple reports or stages of a single report.\n\n3.  **Real LLM & RAG Implementation (High Priority):**\n    *   Integrate with actual LLM APIs (e.g., OpenAI's `openai` library, Anthropic's `anthropic` library) in `LLMOrchestrationService._call_llm_api`.\n    *   Implement a proper embedding model (e.g., from `sentence-transformers` library or via LLM provider's embedding API) for `DataProcessingService._generate_vector_embeddings` and `LLMOrchestrationService._perform_rag`.\n    *   Utilize the chosen Vector Database's SDK for efficient similarity search in `VectorDatabase.retrieve_embeddings`, replacing the naive Euclidean distance calculation.\n\n4.  **Performance Profiling and Monitoring:**\n    *   Once real components are integrated, use Python's `cProfile` or external tools like `Py-Spy` to pinpoint CPU-bound bottlenecks.\n    *   Implement distributed tracing (e.g., OpenTelemetry) to understand latency across microservices.\n    *   Set up comprehensive monitoring with tools like Prometheus and Grafana for system metrics (CPU, memory, network I/O, database query times) and business metrics (reports generated per minute, LLM token cost).\n\n5.  **Refine Caching Strategy:**\n    *   Beyond simply caching the final LLM content for a report, consider caching individual LLM sub-responses, frequently accessed RAG contexts, or pre-computed analytical insights to further reduce LLM calls and improve response times.\n\n6.  **Error Handling and Resilience:**\n    *   Enhance `CustomError` with more specific error types.\n    *   Implement robust retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for external API calls and database operations using libraries like `tenacity`.\n    *   Configure Dead Letter Queues (DLQs) in the message broker for failed messages to ensure no data is lost and can be reprocessed.\n\n7.  **Resource Optimization:**\n    *   For large-scale data processing, consider if Python's single-threaded nature (due to GIL for CPU-bound tasks) is a bottleneck. For heavy NLP/embedding, evaluate using specialized libraries or services that leverage C++/CUDA or distributed processing frameworks.\n    *   Optimize database queries with appropriate indexing to ensure efficient data retrieval, especially from the `DataWarehouse`.## Security Review Report\n\n### Security Score: 5/10\n\n**Rationale:** The provided code implements a foundational framework with a clear microservices-oriented architecture, which is a good starting point for building a secure system. The use of Pydantic for input validation (for `ReportRequest`) and the conceptual inclusion of RAG as a hallucination mitigation strategy are positive. However, as explicitly noted in the code and context, many critical security features are *mocked* or *simulated* using in-memory components. This means that while the *design* may account for security, the *implementation* for production readiness is largely absent. Key vulnerabilities arise from these missing implementations and common pitfalls like hardcoded secrets, which are present even in this demo code.\n\n### Critical Issues (High Priority)\n\n1.  **Hardcoded Sensitive Information (A05:2021-Security Misconfiguration)**:\n    *   `src/modules/config.py` contains hardcoded placeholder values for `LLM_API_KEY`, `SOCIAL_MEDIA_API_KEY`, and `DATABASE_URL`. In a real application, these must be loaded securely from environment variables, a dedicated secrets manager (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault), or a secure configuration system at runtime, never directly committed to source control.\n2.  **Lack of Robust Data Security for Data Stores (A02:2021-Cryptographic Failures, A01:2021-Broken Access Control)**:\n    *   All data stores (`DataLake`, `DataWarehouse`, `VectorDatabase`, `CacheStore`, `MetadataDatabase`) are implemented as in-memory Python dictionaries. This means:\n        *   **No Persistence:** Data is lost on application restart.\n        *   **No Access Control:** Any process or user with access to the Python application's memory can read/modify all data. This is a severe vulnerability in a multi-user or networked environment.\n        *   **No Encryption at Rest or In Transit:** Data is handled in plaintext in memory.\n        *   **No Concurrency Control/Atomicity:** Concurrent operations on these in-memory stores are not thread-safe, leading to data corruption in a real multi-threaded/multi-process environment.\n3.  **LLM Prompt Injection and Data Leakage (A03:2021-Injection, A08:2021-Software and Data Integrity Failures)**:\n    *   The `LLMOrchestrationService` builds prompts by concatenating `base_context`, `Analysis Data`, `Competitive Data`, and `Retrieved Context`. While RAG is conceptualized, there's no explicit sanitization or validation of this input data *before* it forms the prompt. A malicious `ReportRequest` or compromised `processed_data` could lead to:\n        *   **Prompt Injection:** Attacker-controlled data could manipulate the LLM's behavior (e.g., ignore previous instructions, generate harmful content, reveal sensitive internal information).\n        *   **Data Leakage:** If sensitive or PII data exists in the processed data and is passed to an external LLM, it could be exposed to the LLM provider.\n4.  **Insecure Inter-Service Communication (A02:2021-Cryptographic Failures, A01:2021-Broken Access Control)**:\n    *   The `MessageBroker` is a simple in-memory simulation. In a production microservices environment, a real message broker (Kafka, SQS, RabbitMQ) would be used. The current simulation lacks:\n        *   **Authentication and Authorization:** No control over which services can publish/subscribe to which topics.\n        *   **Encryption In-Transit:** Messages are not encrypted, leading to potential eavesdropping.\n        *   **Message Integrity:** No mechanisms to ensure message content hasn't been tampered with.\n\n### Medium Priority Issues\n\n1.  **Insufficient Data Cleansing and Sanitization (A08:2021-Software and Data Integrity Failures)**:\n    *   `DataProcessingService._cleanse_and_normalize` performs only basic lowercasing and stripping. This is inadequate for real-world scenarios where data could contain:\n        *   Malicious scripts (for XSS if displayed).\n        *   SQL injection payloads (if later used in database queries).\n        *   Sensitive PII that needs anonymization/pseudonymization (NFR2.1).\n    *   The dummy embedding generation is not robust; in a real system, a compromised or poorly designed embedding model could lead to irrelevant or even misleading RAG results, impacting report accuracy and potentially revealing unintended information.\n2.  **Potential for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Report Generation (A03:2021-Injection)**:\n    *   `ReportGenerationService._assemble_report_content` uses direct string concatenation for report sections. If any LLM-generated content (or even processed data if vulnerabilities propagate) contains unescaped HTML/JavaScript, and the final report is ever rendered in a web browser without proper output encoding, it could lead to XSS attacks.\n3.  **Verbose Error Messages and Logging (A09:2021-Security Logging and Monitoring Failures)**:\n    *   Error messages and logging, while helpful for debugging (`exc_info=True`), might expose too much internal system detail (e.g., full stack traces, database schemas, internal data structures) to unauthorized parties if logs are not properly secured. The `CustomError` provides some abstraction, but the underlying exceptions could still be logged.\n\n### Low Priority Issues\n\n1.  **Basic Logging Configuration (A09:2021-Security Logging and Monitoring Failures)**:\n    *   `src/modules/utils.py` sets up basic console logging. For production, a more robust logging strategy is needed, including:\n        *   Centralized logging (e.g., ELK Stack, Splunk, cloud-native services).\n        *   Log rotation and retention policies.\n        *   Auditing critical security events (e.g., failed authentication attempts, data access, configuration changes).\n        *   Filtering of sensitive data from logs.\n\n### Security Best Practices Followed\n\n1.  **Modular Microservices Architecture:** The system's design with independent services aids in containing security breaches, isolating failures, and simplifies security patching for individual components.\n2.  **Pydantic for Input Validation:** Using Pydantic models (`ReportRequest`, `MarketAnalysisResults`, etc.) ensures structured and validated inputs/outputs between components, reducing a class of injection vulnerabilities and improving data integrity at API boundaries.\n3.  **Explicit Error Handling:** The use of `CustomError` and `try-except` blocks throughout services demonstrates an awareness of error conditions, allowing for graceful degradation and preventing uncaught exceptions that could leak information or crash the service.\n4.  **Conceptual RAG for LLM Grounding:** The design and mock implementation of RAG in `LLMOrchestrationService` is a crucial step towards mitigating LLM hallucination and improving factual accuracy, which indirectly enhances data integrity.\n5.  **Separation of Configuration:** Although the defaults are insecure, the use of `pydantic-settings` and `.env` for configuration loading demonstrates an intent for separating configuration from code, which is a good practice.\n\n### Recommendations\n\n1.  **Implement Robust Secrets Management:**\n    *   **Action:** Replace hardcoded API keys and sensitive credentials in `src/modules/config.py` with environment variables at minimum, and ideally integrate with a dedicated secrets manager (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault, Google Secret Manager).\n    *   **Tools:** `python-dotenv` for local development, `boto3` (AWS), `azure-sdk-for-python` (Azure), `google-cloud-secret-manager` (GCP), `hvac` (Vault).\n2.  **Adopt Production-Grade Data Stores:**\n    *   **Action:** Replace in-memory data stores with secure, persistent database solutions.\n        *   `DataLake`: AWS S3, Azure Data Lake Storage, Google Cloud Storage.\n        *   `DataWarehouse`, `MetadataDatabase`: PostgreSQL (e.g., AWS RDS, Azure Database for PostgreSQL, GCP Cloud SQL).\n        *   `VectorDatabase`: Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus, or `pgvector` with PostgreSQL.\n        *   `CacheStore`: Redis (with TLS and authentication).\n    *   **Action:** Implement encryption at rest for all stored data and encryption in transit (TLS/SSL) for all database connections.\n    *   **Action:** Enforce strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for database access, using principle of least privilege.\n3.  **Fortify LLM Interactions against Injection:**\n    *   **Action:** Implement robust input sanitization and validation for *all* data flowing into prompts (including `ReportRequest` content and data retrieved for RAG). Consider frameworks that help with prompt template hardening.\n    *   **Action:** Implement output validation and moderation for LLM responses to detect and filter out malicious or unintended content.\n    *   **Action:** For RAG, implement a strict `Document Filtering` and `Pydantic Guardrails` on retrieved documents to ensure only relevant and safe content is passed to the LLM.\n    *   **Action:** Carefully manage the data sent to external LLM providers, ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations and vendor terms. Anonymize/pseudonymize sensitive data before sending if possible.\n    *   **Tools:** OpenAI Evals, Guardrails AI, LangChain/LlamaIndex features for prompt templating and output parsing with validation.\n4.  **Secure Inter-Service Communication:**\n    *   **Action:** Replace the in-memory `MessageBroker` with a production-ready message queue (e.g., Apache Kafka, AWS SQS/SNS, Azure Service Bus, GCP Pub/Sub).\n    *   **Action:** Configure the message broker with authentication, authorization, and encryption in transit (TLS/SSL).\n    *   **Action:** Implement Dead Letter Queues (DLQs) for failed message processing.\n5.  **Implement Comprehensive Data Sanitization:**\n    *   **Action:** Enhance `DataProcessingService._cleanse_and_normalize` with more sophisticated sanitization techniques:\n        *   HTML/script tag stripping/encoding (e.g., using `Bleach` or `html.escape`).\n        *   SQL character escaping/parameterized queries (if data were used for direct SQL).\n        *   Regular expressions for pattern-based cleaning.\n        *   Consider data anonymization/pseudonymization for sensitive entities.\n    *   **Action:** Implement a robust, dedicated embedding service using well-known models (e.g., `sentence-transformers` library, OpenAI embeddings API) with proper versioning and quality control.\n6.  **Protect Report Output from XSS:**\n    *   **Action:** If reports are ever displayed in a web interface, ensure all dynamic content inserted into the HTML is properly HTML-escaped to prevent XSS.\n    *   **Action:** If generating document formats like DOCX or PDF, use libraries that handle content embedding securely and prevent macro injection or other document-specific vulnerabilities.\n7.  **Enhance Logging, Monitoring, and Alerting:**\n    *   **Action:** Implement a centralized logging solution (e.g., ELK Stack, Prometheus+Grafana, cloud-native monitoring).\n    *   **Action:** Configure log rotation, retention, and access controls.\n    *   **Action:** Implement metrics collection and alerts for critical security events (e.g., excessive failed login attempts, unusual data access patterns, service errors).\n    *   **Action:** Ensure sensitive information is redacted or masked in logs.\n    *   **Tools:** `logging` module (enhanced handlers), `Loguru`, Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry, Sentry.\n\n### Compliance Notes\n\n*   **OWASP Top 10 Considerations:**\n    *   **A01:2021-Broken Access Control:** This is a major concern due to the mock in-memory stores lacking any access control. In a real deployment, strong access control (RBAC) must be implemented across all services and data stores.\n    *   **A02:2021-Cryptographic Failures:** Data is currently unencrypted. Encryption at rest and in transit is critical for all components.\n    *   **A03:2021-Injection:** Prompt Injection is a primary concern for LLM-driven applications. Strong input validation and output encoding are necessary to mitigate this, along with other potential injection types like XSS.\n    *   **A05:2021-Security Misconfiguration:** Hardcoding API keys is a direct violation. Secure configuration management is paramount.\n    *   **A07:2021-Identification and Authentication Failures:** Not addressed in the provided code. A real system requires robust authentication and session management for users and inter-service communication.\n    *   **A08:2021-Software and Data Integrity Failures:** Lack of robust data sanitization and weak mock embedding generation highlight potential for data integrity issues.\n    *   **A09:2021-Security Logging and Monitoring Failures:** The basic logging setup needs significant enhancement for production visibility and incident response.\n\n*   **Industry Standard Compliance:**\n    *   **GDPR/CCPA/HIPAA (if applicable):** If the market research involves personal data, strict adherence to data privacy regulations is required, including data anonymization, consent management, and secure data handling.\n    *   **NIST Cybersecurity Framework:** Implement controls for Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover, especially for data protection, access control, and incident response.\n    *   **ISO 27001:** Adhere to information security management system principles, covering risk assessment, security controls, and continuous improvement.\n\nIn summary, the provided code serves as an excellent functional proof-of-concept. However, transitioning it to a secure, production-ready system will require significant engineering effort focused on implementing the robust security controls outlined in these recommendations, moving beyond the current in-memory mock components.## Refactored Code Implementation\n\n### Summary of Changes\nThe refactored code addresses critical feedback from the Quality, Performance, and Security reviews, transitioning the framework from a purely in-memory, synchronous simulation to an **asynchronous-first, conceptually production-ready design**. Key improvements include:\n\n1.  **True Asynchronous Workflow (Conceptual):** The `ReportOrchestrator` and all service methods are now `async` functions, demonstrating non-blocking I/O and interaction with a truly asynchronous `MessageBroker` (still in-memory for demo purposes but designed for real-world integration). This is a foundational change for scalability.\n2.  **Enhanced Data Store Abstraction:** While still in-memory, data store classes (`DataLake`, `DataWarehouse`, `VectorDatabase`, `CacheStore`, `MetadataDatabase`) now use `async` methods and are commented to explicitly highlight their real-world counterparts and security/performance considerations (e.g., encryption, access control).\n3.  **LLM Orchestration Realism:** The `LLMOrchestrationService`'s `_call_llm_api` and `_perform_rag` methods are `async` and include expanded comments detailing real-world complexities like rate limits, token management, and advanced RAG techniques. Conceptual prompt injection mitigation is noted.\n4.  **Granular Error Handling:** Introduced more specific custom exception types (`DataIngestionError`, `DataProcessingError`, `MarketAnalysisError`, `LLMGenerationError`, `ReportGenerationError`) for better error diagnostics and handling.\n5.  **Security Enhancements (Conceptual):** Addressed hardcoded secrets by removing them and emphasizing environment variables/secrets managers. Added comments on data sanitization, prompt injection mitigation, and XSS prevention for report output.\n6.  **Improved Code Quality:** Added missing module-level docstrings, refined comments for clarity, and corrected a unit test error in `test_data_ingestion.py`. Expanded unit tests for `DataProcessingService`, `MarketAnalysisService`, and `ReportGenerationService`.\n\n### Refactored Code\n\n```python\n# src/main.py\n\nimport logging\nimport asyncio\nfrom typing import Dict, Any\n\nfrom modules.config import Settings\nfrom modules.models import ReportRequest, ReportContentSections, MarketAnalysisResults\nfrom modules.message_broker import MessageBroker\nfrom modules.data_ingestion_service import DataIngestionService\nfrom modules.data_processing_service import DataProcessingService\nfrom modules.market_analysis_service import MarketAnalysisService\nfrom modules.llm_orchestration_service import LLMOrchestrationService\nfrom modules.report_generation_service import ReportGenerationService\nfrom modules.data_stores import DataLake, DataWarehouse, VectorDatabase, CacheStore, MetadataDatabase\nfrom modules.utils import setup_logging, ReportGenerationError, DataIngestionError, DataProcessingError, MarketAnalysisError, LLMGenerationError, ReportAssemblyError\n\nsetup_logging()\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\nclass ReportOrchestrator:\n    \"\"\"\n    The Request Orchestrator Service.

The `Settings` class now relies entirely on `pydantic-settings` to load these values from environment variables or a `.env` file, with placeholders (`Field(...)`) clearly indicating they are mandatory and should be provided securely. This pushes the responsibility of secret management to the deployment environment (e.g., using Kubernetes Secrets, AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault).\n2.  **Data Security in Data Stores (Conceptual):**\n    *   **Vulnerability Addressed:** In-memory data stores lacked persistence, access control, and encryption.\n    *   **New Measures Implemented:** Comments in `src/modules/data_stores.py` now explicitly outline the need for production-grade solutions (AWS S3, PostgreSQL, Pinecone, Redis) that support encryption at rest and in transit (TLS/SSL), robust access control (RBAC), and concurrency management. While the demo remains in-memory, the design intent is clear.\n3.  **LLM Prompt Injection and Data Leakage Mitigation (Conceptual):**\n    *   **Vulnerability Addressed:** Potential for malicious input data to manipulate LLM behavior or sensitive data leakage through prompts.\n    *   **New Measures Implemented:** Comments in `src/modules/llm_orchestration_service.py` (`_perform_rag`, `handle_analytical_insights`) emphasize the importance of:\n        *   **Input Sanitization:** Validating and sanitizing all data used to construct prompts.\n        *   **Output Validation/Moderation:** Implementing checks on LLM responses.\n        *   **Data Minimization:** Sending only strictly necessary data to external LLM APIs.\n        *   **PII Anonymization:** Pseudonymizing or anonymizing sensitive Personal Identifiable Information (PII) before it reaches the LLM.\n4.  **Insecure Inter-Service Communication (Conceptual):**\n    *   **Vulnerability Addressed:** The in-memory `MessageBroker` simulation lacked authentication, authorization, and encryption.\n    *   **New Measures Implemented:** Comments in `src/modules/message_broker.py` clarify that a real message broker (Kafka, SQS) requires secure configuration, including TLS for encryption in transit and access controls for topics. The asynchronous nature of the refactored broker also better decouples services, a security benefit.\n5.  **Output Sanitization for XSS (Conceptual):**\n    *   **Vulnerability Addressed:** Potential for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if LLM-generated content or processed data contained malicious scripts and was rendered in a web environment.\n    *   **New Measures Implemented:** A placeholder for sanitization (`value.replace(\"<script>\", \"&lt;script&gt;\")`) has been added in `src/modules/llm_orchestration_service.py` after LLM content generation. Comments in `src/modules/report_generation_service.py` explicitly mention the need for proper HTML escaping or using secure document generation libraries.\n\n### Performance Optimizations\n\n1.  **True Asynchronous Workflow:**\n    *   **Performance Improvements:** The most significant performance optimization is the refactoring of the `ReportOrchestrator` (`src/main.py`) and all service methods (`DataIngestionService`, `DataProcessingService`, `MarketAnalysisService`, `LLMOrchestrationService`, `ReportGenerationService`) to use Python's `asyncio`. This changes the entire workflow from blocking and sequential to non-blocking and concurrent.\n    *   **Optimization Techniques Applied:**\n        *   **`async/await` Keywords:** Used extensively to allow other tasks to run while I/O-bound operations (like simulated external API calls or database interactions) are pending.\n        *   **`asyncio.gather`:** Used in `LLMOrchestrationService.handle_analytical_insights` to initiate multiple LLM calls concurrently, drastically reducing overall latency for report generation.\n        *   **Simulated Asynchronous I/O:** `asyncio.sleep()` calls are strategically placed in mocked external interactions (data stores, LLM API, web scraping) to simulate real-world network latency and I/O overhead, demonstrating how `asyncio` would manage these waits efficiently.\n2.  **Optimized Data Stores (Conceptual):**\n    *   **Performance Improvements:** While still in-memory, the `async` methods for data stores (`src/modules/data_stores.py`) signal the intent to use actual high-performance, scalable databases (e.g., dedicated Vector DBs like Pinecone for fast ANN search, Redis for low-latency caching).\n    *   **Optimization Techniques Applied:** Comments now highlight that real implementations would leverage optimized indexing, distributed capabilities, and in-memory benefits (for cache) to handle large data volumes and high query rates (NFR1.2).\n3.  **Strategic LLM Usage & Caching (Conceptual):**\n    *   **Performance Improvements:** The `LLMOrchestrationService` includes conceptual caching of LLM-generated content (`await self.cache_store.set`).\n    *   **Optimization Techniques Applied:** In a real implementation, this would reduce redundant LLM API calls, which are high-latency and costly, significantly improving overall report generation time for recurring requests or segments. Further prompt engineering and model selection (using smaller, faster models for specific tasks) are also mentioned.\n\n### Quality Enhancements\n\n1.  **Improved Code Readability and Maintainability:**\n    *   **Asynchronous Pattern Clarity:** The consistent application of `async/await` makes the intended asynchronous flow explicit, improving the understanding of concurrency.\n    *   **Modular Docstrings:** Added module-level docstrings to all Python files in `src/modules`, providing a high-level overview of each module's purpose and contents (e.g., `src/modules/config.py`, `src/modules/data_ingestion_service.py`).\n    *   **Enhanced Method Docstrings:** Many method docstrings were expanded to include more details about real-world complexities and the purpose of the simulated logic (e.g., in `_cleanse_and_normalize`, `_call_llm_api`).\n    *   **Clearer Comments:** More detailed inline comments explain the purpose of simulated components and point to real-world considerations (e.g., \"In a real system, this would be...\").\n2.  **Better Error Handling and Logging:**\n    *   **Granular Custom Exceptions:** Replaced the generic `CustomError` with more specific exception types (`DataIngestionError`, `DataProcessingError`, `MarketAnalysisError`, `LLMGenerationError`, `ReportAssemblyError`, `ReportGenerationError` as a base) in `src/modules/utils.py`.\n    *   **Specific `try-except` Blocks:** The `ReportOrchestrator` (`src/main.py`) now wraps each major step (Ingestion, Processing, Analysis, LLM, Report Assembly) in its own `try-except` block, catching specific custom errors. This allows for more precise error identification and potentially more sophisticated recovery strategies in a production system.\n    *   **Contextual Logging:** Error logs now include more context, such as the `report_id` and the specific stage of failure, making debugging easier. `exc_info=True` is consistently used for full traceback logging.\n3.  **Refined Logic and Structure:**\n    *   The `ReportOrchestrator`'s internal structure now more cleanly separates the orchestration logic from the actual service calls, improving the clarity of the workflow.\n    *   The executive summary generation logic in `src/modules/report_generation_service.py` has been slightly refined to better identify section boundaries.\n\n### Updated Tests\n\nAll existing tests were updated to support `asyncio` using `unittest.IsolatedAsyncioTestCase` and `AsyncMock`. New, more comprehensive tests were added for core services.\n\n```python\n# tests/test_orchestrator.py - (Updated, see above)\n# tests/test_data_ingestion.py - (Updated, see above)\n# tests/test_llm_orchestration.py - (Updated, see above)\n# tests/test_data_processing.py - (New/Updated, see above)\n# tests/test_market_analysis.py - (New/Updated, see above)\n# tests/test_report_generation.py - (New/Updated, see above)\n```\n\n### Migration Guide\n\nThis refactoring involves significant changes, particularly the transition to an asynchronous programming model.\n\n1.  **Update Python Version:** Ensure your environment is Python 3.7+ (preferably 3.9+) to fully support `async/await` features.\n2.  **Install `pydantic-settings`:** If not already installed, `pip install pydantic-settings`.\n3.  **Update Codebase:** Replace all existing files with the refactored code provided. Pay close attention to the new `async` keywords and `await` calls.\n4.  **Environment Variables for Secrets:**\n    *   **Breaking Change:** The hardcoded API keys and database URLs have been removed from `src/modules/config.py`.\n    *   **Action:** You *must* now define these as environment variables or in a `.env` file in your project root before running the application.\n        ```\n        # .env\n        LLM_API_KEY=\"your_actual_llm_api_key_here\"\n        SOCIAL_MEDIA_API_KEY=\"your_actual_social_media_api_key_here\"\n        DATABASE_URL=\"sqlite:///./app.db\" # Or a real DB connection string\n        ```\n5.  **Running the Application:**\n    *   The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block in `src/main.py` now uses `asyncio.run(orchestrator.generate_report(sample_request))` to correctly execute the asynchronous workflow.\n    *   **Action:** Run with `python src/main.py`.\n6.  **Running Tests:**\n    *   **Breaking Change:** Tests now require `unittest.IsolatedAsyncioTestCase`.\n    *   **Action:** Run tests using `python -m unittest discover tests`.\n7.  **Future Integrations:**\n    *   This refactored code *still uses in-memory simulations* for external services (LLM APIs, databases, message broker). The `async` nature prepares the code for seamless integration with real asynchronous clients for these services (e.g., `httpx` for HTTP calls, `aiopg` for PostgreSQL, `aiokafka` for Kafka, official SDKs for cloud services).\n    *   **Action:** When migrating to a production environment, replace the simulated logic within `_call_llm_api`, `DataLake`, `DataWarehouse`, `VectorDatabase`, `CacheStore`, `MetadataDatabase`, and `MessageBroker` with actual client libraries for your chosen technologies. This will involve adding relevant `pip` dependencies.\n    *   **Breaking Change (Conceptual):** The current `MessageBroker` is still simple. A real broker integration would involve separate consumer processes/tasks that truly listen to message queues, rather than the orchestrator directly `awaiting` for `process_ingested_data` etc. This is a larger architectural shift beyond this refactoring's scope but is enabled by the new async design.## Complete Documentation Package\n\n### README.md\n```markdown\n# LLM-Guided Market Research Report Generation Framework\n\n## Overview\nThis project delivers a comprehensive, LLM-guided framework for generating Gartner-style market research reports.

The core interaction is through the `ReportOrchestrator` service, which coordinates the entire report generation workflow.\n\n## Classes and Methods\n\n### `ReportRequest` (Pydantic Model)\nRepresents a user's request for a market research report. It defines the scope and specific requirements for the report generation.\n\n```python\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\nfrom typing import List, Dict, Any, Optional\n\nclass ReportRequest(BaseModel):\n    industry: str = Field(..., description=\"The target industry for the report.\")\n    competitors: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list, description=\"List of key competitors to analyze.\")\n    market_segments: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list, description=\"List of specific market segments to focus on.\")\n    time_period: str = Field(\"current\", description=\"Time period for the analysis (e.g., '2023-2028', 'current').\")\n    key_metrics: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list, description=\"Specific metrics to include in the analysis (e.g., 'market share', 'growth rate').\")\n    custom_instructions: Optional[str] = Field(None, description=\"Any additional custom instructions or focus areas for the report.\")\n```\n\n### `MarketAnalysisResults` (Pydantic Model)\nA consolidated Pydantic model representing the structured output from the Market Analysis Service. This object serves as the structured input context for the LLM Orchestration Service.\n\n```python\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\nfrom typing import List, Dict, Any, Optional\n\nclass IndustryOverview(BaseModel):\n    market_name: str = Field(..., description=\"Name of the industry or market.\")\n    market_size_usd_bn: float = Field(..., description=\"Estimated market size in billion USD.\")\n    annual_growth_rate_percent: float = Field(..., description=\"Projected annual growth rate in percentage.\")\n    growth_drivers: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list, description=\"Key factors driving market growth.\")\n    challenges: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list, description=\"Significant challenges or obstacles in the industry.\")\n    key_segments: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list, description=\"Major segments within the industry.\")\n\nclass CompetitiveLandscape(BaseModel):\n    competitors_overview: Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]] = Field(\n        description=\"Dictionary where key is competitor name, value is dict of their stats (e.g., market_share_percent, strengths, weaknesses, key_strategies).\"\n    )\n\nclass MarketTrendsPredictions(BaseModel):\n    current_trends: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list, description=\"List of prevailing market trends.\")\n    emerging_patterns: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list, description=\"New or developing patterns observed in the market.\")\n    future_predictions: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list, description=\"Forecasted developments and changes in the market.\")\n    time_horizon: str = Field(..., description=\"The time horizon for the predictions (e.g., '5 years', '2028').\")\n\nclass TechnologyAdoption(BaseModel):\n    adopted_technologies: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list, description=\"List of key technologies relevant to the industry.\")\n    adoption_rates: Dict[str, float] = Field(default_factory=dict, description=\"Dictionary of technology names to their estimated adoption rates (percentage).\")\n    recommendations: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list, description=\"Strategic recommendations related to technology application or integration.\")\n    key_drivers: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list, description=\"Factors driving the adoption of specified technologies.\")\n\nclass MarketAnalysisResults(BaseModel):\n    industry_overview: IndustryOverview = Field(..., description=\"Detailed overview of the industry.\")\n    competitive_landscape: CompetitiveLandscape = Field(..., description=\"Analysis of the competitive environment.\")\n    market_trends_predictions: MarketTrendsPredictions = Field(..., description=\"Identified market trends and future outlook.\")\n    technology_adoption: TechnologyAdoption = Field(..., description=\"Analysis of technology adoption and recommendations.\")\n```\n\n### `ReportOrchestrator`\nThe central service responsible for coordinating the end-to-end workflow for generating market research reports. It orchestrates asynchronous calls to various underlying services.\n\n```python\nclass ReportOrchestrator:\n    def __init__(self, settings: Settings):\n        # ... (initializes data stores and services)\n\n    async def generate_report(self, request: ReportRequest) -> Dict[str, Any]:\n        \"\"\"\n        Generates a comprehensive market research report based on the given request.\n        This method orchestrates the entire asynchronous workflow, including:\n        1. Data Ingestion\n        2. Data Processing (Cleansing, Transformation, Embedding)\n        3. Market Analysis\n        4. LLM Content Generation (using RAG)\n        5. Report Assembly\n        6. Executive Summary Generation\n\n        Args:\n            request: A ReportRequest object specifying the research criteria.\n\n        Returns:\n            A dictionary containing the generated report content and executive summary.\n            Example:\n            {\n                \"report_id\": \"unique_report_identifier\",\n                \"executive_summary\": \"Concise summary text...\",\n                \"full_report_content\": \"Full markdown report content...\",\n                \"status\": \"success\"\n            }\n\n        Raises:\n            ReportGenerationError: If any critical step in the report generation fails,\n                                   with specific subclasses like DataIngestionError,\n                                   LLMGenerationError, etc., providing more detail.\n        \"\"\"\n```\n\n## Examples\n\n### Generating a Market Research Report\nTo generate a report, instantiate the `ReportOrchestrator` and call its `generate_report` method with a `ReportRequest` object. The `generate_report` method is asynchronous, so it must be awaited within an `asyncio` event loop.\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nfrom src.main import ReportOrchestrator\nfrom src.modules.models import ReportRequest\nfrom src.modules.config import Settings\nfrom src.modules.utils import ReportGenerationError\n\nasync def main():\n    settings = Settings()\n    # Ensure LLM_API_KEY and other sensitive settings are loaded from .env or environment variables\n    # settings.LLM_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"LLM_API_KEY\", \"your_default_key_if_needed\") \n    # settings.SOCIAL_MEDIA_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"SOCIAL_MEDIA_API_KEY\", \"your_default_key_if_needed\")\n\n    orchestrator = ReportOrchestrator(settings)\n\n    sample_request = ReportRequest(\n        industry=\"Artificial Intelligence\",\n        competitors=[\"OpenAI\", \"Google\", \"Microsoft\"],\n        market_segments=[\"Generative AI\", \"Computer Vision\", \"Natural Language Processing\"],\n        time_period=\"2024-2030\",\n        key_metrics=[\"adoption rate\", \"funding trends\", \"patent filings\"],\n        custom_instructions=\"Focus on the impact of large language models on enterprise solutions.\"\n    )\n\n    try:\n        print(\"Submitting report request...\")\n        report = await orchestrator.generate_report(sample_request)\n        print(\"\\n--- REPORT GENERATED SUCCESSFULLY ---\")\n        print(f\"Report ID: {report['report_id']}\")\n        print(\"\\n--- EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ---\")\n        print(report['executive_summary'])\n        print(\"\\n--- FULL REPORT PREVIEW (First 1000 chars) ---\")\n        print(report['full_report_content'][:1000] + \"...\")\n        print(\"\\n------------------------------------\")\n    except ReportGenerationError as e:\n        print(f\"Report generation failed: {e}\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An unexpected error occurred: {e}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    asyncio.run(main())\n```\n```\n\n### User Guide\n```markdown\n# User Guide\n\nThis guide provides instructions on how to use the LLM-Guided Market Research Report Generation Framework to generate comprehensive market intelligence reports.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### 1. Define Your Research Scope\nTo generate a report, you need to provide a `ReportRequest` specifying your research needs. This is the primary input to the system. The clearer and more specific your request, the more targeted and relevant the generated report will be.\n\n**Key parameters for `ReportRequest`:**\n*   `industry` (Required): The primary industry or market you want to analyze (e.g., \"Cloud Computing\", \"Fintech\", \"Renewable Energy\").\n*   `competitors` (Optional): A list of specific companies or organizations you want to include in the competitive landscape analysis (e.g., `[\"AWS\", \"Azure\", \"Google Cloud\"]`).\n*   `market_segments` (Optional): Specific sub-segments within the industry to focus on (e.g., `[\"IaaS\", \"PaaS\", \"SaaS Infrastructure\"]`).\n*   `time_period` (Optional, default: \"current\"): The time frame for the analysis (e.g., \"2023-2028\", \"next 5 years\", \"current\").\n*   `key_metrics` (Optional): Specific metrics or data points you are interested in (e.g., `[\"market share\", \"growth rate\", \"innovation index\", \"ROI\"]`).\n*   `custom_instructions` (Optional): Any additional instructions or specific areas of focus for the LLM to consider during content generation. This is useful for highly niche or sensitive topics.\n\n### 2. Submitting a Request\nCurrently, interaction is demonstrated via the `src/main.py` script, which simulates an API call. In a deployed system, you would typically interact with a RESTful API endpoint.\n\n**Example (as seen in `src/main.py`):**\n```python\nfrom src.modules.models import ReportRequest\n\nsample_request = ReportRequest(\n    industry=\"Cloud Computing\",\n    competitors=[\"AWS\", \"Azure\", \"Google Cloud\"],\n    market_segments=[\"IaaS\", \"PaaS\", \"SaaS Infrastructure\"],\n    time_period=\"2023-2028\",\n    key_metrics=[\"market share\", \"growth rate\", \"innovation index\"]\n)\n# In a real API, you would send this as a JSON payload to an endpoint.\n# E.g., via a POST request to `/generate_report`\n# response = requests.post(\"http://api.yourdomain.com/generate_report\", json=sample_request.model_dump())\n```\n\n### 3. Interpreting the Report\nThe generated report will be returned in a structured format (e.g., Markdown text, which can be converted to PDF/DOCX in a full implementation). It includes:\n*   **Report ID:** A unique identifier for your generated report.\n*   **Executive Summary:** A high-level overview of the most critical findings, insights, and recommendations. This is designed for quick consumption by executives.\n*   **Full Report Content:** The detailed report organized into sections:\n    *   Industry Analysis\n    *   Competitive Landscape\n    *   Market Trends and Future Predictions\n    *   Technology Adoption Analysis and Recommendations\n    *   Strategic Insights and Actionable Recommendations\n\n## Advanced Usage\n\n### Customizing Report Focus\nLeverage the `custom_instructions` field in `ReportRequest` to steer the LLM's focus. For example:\n*   \"Analyze the impact of quantum computing on the financial services sector, specifically focusing on fraud detection.\"\n*   \"Provide recommendations for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to adopt AI solutions, considering budget constraints.\"\n\n### Continuous Market Monitoring (Conceptual)\nThe framework is designed with an event-driven architecture that *can* support continuous market monitoring. In a fully implemented version, this would mean:\n*   Regularly scheduled data ingestion tasks (e.g., daily news scrapes, hourly API calls).\n*   Automated re-generation or updating of reports when significant new data or trends are identified.\n*   Alerting mechanisms to notify users of critical market shifts.\n\n## Best Practices\n\n*   **Be Specific in Requests:** The more precise your `industry`, `competitors`, and `market_segments` are, the better the LLM can narrow its focus and provide relevant content.\n*   **Iterate on `custom_instructions`:** For complex or nuanced topics, you may need to try different `custom_instructions` to achieve the desired depth and perspective in your report.\n*   **Review LLM Outputs Critically:** While the framework employs RAG to reduce hallucinations, always critically review the generated content for factual accuracy, bias, and relevance. LLMs are powerful tools, but human oversight remains crucial for high-stakes decisions.\n*   **Consider Data Freshness:** Understand the data sources feeding the system. If real-time insights are paramount, ensure the underlying data ingestion mechanisms are configured for high-frequency updates.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### General Issues\n*   **\"Failed to generate report\"**: This is a catch-all error indicating a failure in one of the report generation stages. Check the detailed logs for specific error messages.\n    *   `DataIngestionError`: Problem with collecting raw data. Check internet connectivity, API keys, or if the requested data is available.\n    *   `DataProcessingError`: Issue during data cleansing, transformation, or embedding generation. This could be due to malformed raw data or internal processing logic.\n    *   `MarketAnalysisError`: Failure during the structured market analysis. This might be due to unexpected data formats or issues with analytical models.\n    *   `LLMGenerationError`: The Large Language Model failed to generate content. This can happen due to:\n        *   **API Key Issues:** Ensure `LLM_API_KEY` in your `.env` file is correct and active.\n        *   **Rate Limits:** The LLM provider might be imposing rate limits. Wait a bit and retry.\n        *   **Context Window Limits:** Very broad or extensive requests might exceed the LLM's context window. Try to narrow down your `custom_instructions` or `time_period`.\n        *   **Unexpected LLM Output:** The LLM might return an unparseable response.\n    *   `ReportAssemblyError`: Problem combining the generated sections into a final report. This might indicate an issue with the LLM output format not matching the report template.\n\n### Log Analysis\nThe framework uses standard Python logging. To troubleshoot, review the console output for `WARNING` and `ERROR` level messages. Increasing the logging level to `DEBUG` in `src/modules/utils.py` can provide more verbose insights into the internal workings.\n\n```python\n# In src/modules/utils.py, change:\nlogging.basicConfig(\n    level=logging.INFO, # Change to logging.DEBUG for verbose output\n    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',\n    handlers=[\n        logging.StreamHandler(sys.stdout)\n    ]\n)\n```\n\nFor production deployments, ensure logs are collected by a centralized logging system (e.g., ELK Stack, Splunk, cloud-native log management) for easier analysis and alerting.\n```\n\n### Developer Guide\n```markdown\n# Developer Guide\n\nThis guide provides an in-depth look into the architecture, design decisions, and guidelines for developing and contributing to the LLM-Guided Market Research Report Generation Framework.\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\nThe system is built upon a **Microservices Architecture** with an **Event-Driven backbone**, implemented using Python's `asyncio` for non-blocking operations. This design ensures modularity, scalability, resilience, and efficient handling of diverse data sources and asynchronous processing required for LLM interactions and continuous market monitoring.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[User Interface / API Gateway] --> B(Request Orchestrator Service)\n    B --> C(Data Ingestion Service)\n    B --> D(Market Analysis Service)\n    B --> E(LLM Orchestration Service)\n    B --> F(Report Generation Service)\n\n    C -- Publishes Data Ingestion Events --> G(Message Broker)\n    G -- Consumes Data Ingestion Events --> H(Data Processing Service)\n    H -- Stores Raw Data --> I(Data Lake)\n    H -- Stores Processed Data --> J(Data Warehouse)\n    H -- Stores Embeddings --> K(Vector Database)\n\n    D -- Queries --> J\n    D -- Publishes Analytical Insights Events --> G\n    G -- Consumes Analytical Insights Events --> E\n\n    E -- Queries --> J\n    E -- Queries --> K\n    E -- Calls --> L(External LLM APIs)\n    E -- Publishes LLM Generated Content Events --> G\n    G -- Consumes LLM Content Events --> F\n\n    F -- Stores Reports --> M(Report Storage)\n    M -- Retrieves Reports --> A\n\n    SubGraph Data Stores\n        I(Data Lake)\n        J(Data Warehouse)\n        K(Vector Database)\n        N(Cache Store)\n        O(Metadata Database)\n    End\n\n    B -- Updates State --> O\n    A -- Retrieves Config --> O\n    E -- Uses --> N\n\n    style A fill:#DDF,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    style L fill:#DDE,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    style G fill:#EEE,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    linkStyle 0 stroke-width:2px,fill:none,stroke:blue;\n    linkStyle 1 stroke-width:2px,fill:none,stroke:blue;\n    linkStyle 2 stroke-width:2px,fill:none,stroke:blue;\n    linkStyle 3 stroke-width:2px,fill:none,stroke:blue;\n    linkStyle 4 stroke-width:2px,fill:none,stroke:blue;\n    linkStyle 5 stroke-width:2px,fill:none,stroke:blue;\n    linkStyle 6 stroke-width:2px,fill:none,stroke:green;\n    linkStyle 7 stroke-width:2px,fill:none,stroke:green;\n    linkStyle 8 stroke-width:2px,fill:none,stroke:green;\n    linkStyle 9 stroke-width:2px,fill:none,stroke:green;\n    linkStyle 10 stroke-width:2px,fill:none,stroke:green;\n    linkStyle 11 stroke-width:2px,fill:none,stroke:green;\n    linkStyle 12 stroke-width:2px,fill:none,stroke:green;\n    linkStyle 13 stroke-width:2px,fill:none,stroke:green;\n    linkStyle 14 stroke-width:2px,fill:none,stroke:green;\n    linkStyle 15 stroke-width:2px,fill:none,stroke:green;\n    linkStyle 16 stroke-width:2px,fill:none,stroke:green;\n    linkStyle 17 stroke-width:2px,fill:none,stroke:green;\n    linkStyle 18 stroke-width:2px,fill:none,stroke:green;\n    linkStyle 19 stroke-width:2px,fill:none,stroke:green;\n```\n\n**Key Components:**\n\n1.  **User Interface (UI) / API Gateway (Conceptual):** The entry point for users. In a full deployment, this would be a web frontend (e.g., React, Vue.js) or a RESTful API built with FastAPI.\n2.  **Request Orchestrator Service (`src/main.py`):** Coordinates the overall report generation workflow. It receives requests, breaks them into sub-tasks, and orchestrates calls to other services. Implemented asynchronously to manage the flow efficiently.\n3.  **Data Ingestion Service (`src/modules/data_ingestion_service.py`):** Responsible for collecting raw data from various sources (simulated APIs, web scraping). Designed to handle concurrent data fetching.\n4.  **Data Processing Service (`src/modules/data_processing_service.py`):** Cleanses, normalizes, transforms raw data, and generates vector embeddings for RAG.\n5.  **Market Analysis Service (`src/modules/market_analysis_service.py`):** Performs quantitative and qualitative analysis on structured data, identifying market trends, competitive landscapes, and technology adoption patterns.\n6.  **LLM Orchestration Service (`src/modules/llm_orchestration_service.py`):** Manages interactions with Large Language Models, including sophisticated prompt engineering and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using the Vector Database and Data Warehouse for context.\n7.  **Report Generation Service (`src/modules/report_generation_service.py`):** Assembles LLM-generated content with structured data into the final Gartner-style report and generates the executive summary.\n8.  **Data Stores (`src/modules/data_stores.py` - Simulated):**\n    *   `DataLake`: For raw, unstructured data (conceptually AWS S3).\n    *   `DataWarehouse`: For cleansed, structured data (conceptually PostgreSQL).\n    *   `VectorDatabase`: For dense vector embeddings (conceptually Pinecone, Weaviate, pgvector).\n    *   `CacheStore`: For high-speed caching (conceptually Redis).\n    *   `MetadataDatabase`: For workflow state and report metadata (conceptually PostgreSQL).\n9.  **Message Broker (`src/modules/message_broker.py` - Simulated):** Facilitates asynchronous communication and decoupling between services using an event-driven pattern (conceptually Apache Kafka, AWS SQS/SNS).\n\n**Design Principles:**\n*   **Asynchronous First:** All inter-service communications and I/O-bound operations are designed with `asyncio` to ensure high throughput and low latency.\n*   **Modularity:** Each service is loosely coupled and adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle, facilitating independent development, testing, and deployment.\n*   **Pydantic Models:** Used extensively for data validation and clear data contract definition between services.\n*   **Error Handling:** Granular custom exception types (`src/modules/utils.py`) are used for specific failure scenarios, enabling robust error logging and potential retry mechanisms.\n\n## Contributing Guidelines\n\nWe welcome contributions to enhance this framework.

Configure backups, replication, and performance tuning.\n    *   **Vector Database:** Integrate with a specialized vector database service (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate Cloud) or a PostgreSQL instance with `pgvector` for vector embeddings.\n    *   **Cache Store:** Use a managed in-memory cache service (e.g., AWS ElastiCache for Redis, Azure Cache for Redis, GCP Memorystore for Redis).\n\n5.  **LLM Integration:**\n    *   Integrate with actual LLM APIs (e.g., OpenAI API, Anthropic API, Google Gemini API) using their official Python SDKs.\n    *   Implement robust retry mechanisms and circuit breakers for LLM API calls to handle transient errors and rate limits.\n    *   Monitor token usage and costs.\n\n6.  **Secrets Management:**\n    *   Store all API keys, database credentials, and other sensitive information in a dedicated secrets manager (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault, Google Secret Manager).\n    *   Configure your deployment environment to securely inject these secrets into your application containers at runtime.\n\n7.  **CI/CD Pipeline:**\n    *   Set up a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins).\n    *   Automate testing, container image building, and deployment to your chosen cloud environment.\n\n8.  **Monitoring and Logging:**\n    *   Implement centralized logging (e.g., ELK Stack, Splunk, cloud-native logging services like AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, GCP Operations Suite).\n    *   Set up comprehensive application performance monitoring (APM) and alerting (e.g., Prometheus/Grafana, Datadog) to track service health, performance metrics, and potential issues.\n    *   Implement distributed tracing (e.g., OpenTelemetry) to gain visibility into requests flowing across microservices.\n\n9.  **Network Security:**\n    *   Deploy services within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) or similar isolated network.\n    *   Configure strict security groups, network ACLs, and firewalls to control inbound and outbound traffic.\n    *   Enforce TLS/SSL for all inter-service communication and external API endpoints.\n```\n\n### Quality and Security Notes\n```markdown\n# Quality and Security Report\n\nThis report summarizes the code quality, security posture, and performance characteristics of the LLM-Guided Market Research Report Generation Framework, highlighting known limitations and recommendations for production deployment.\n\n## Code Quality Summary\n\n**Strengths:**\n*   **Modular & Asynchronous Architecture:** The refactored code effectively implements a microservices-oriented, event-driven architecture using `asyncio`, promoting scalability, maintainability, and responsiveness.\n*   **Clear Data Models:** Extensive use of `Pydantic` models ensures strong typing, data validation, and improves overall code readability and consistency.\n*   **Enhanced Error Handling:** Introduction of granular custom exceptions and specific `try-except` blocks allows for better error identification, logging, and more robust handling.\n*   **Comprehensive Documentation & Setup:** Module-level docstrings, detailed method docstrings, and clear installation/usage instructions significantly aid in understanding and operating the codebase.\n*   **Logging Implementation:** Consistent and contextual logging across modules is vital for monitoring and debugging.\n*   **Testing Foundation:** The updated unit tests leverage `unittest.IsolatedAsyncioTestCase` and `AsyncMock` to effectively test asynchronous components, providing a solid base for quality assurance.\n\n**Areas for Improvement (from a production readiness standpoint):**\n*   **Real Asynchronous Processing:** While `async/await` are used, the in-memory `MessageBroker` and direct `await` calls in the orchestrator still simulate the full asynchronous decoupling that a real message queue (like Kafka) would provide.\n*   **LLM Orchestration Realism:** The dummy LLM calls and simplified RAG (embedding generation, retrieval) oversimplify the complexities of real LLM interactions (rate limits, token management, cost, advanced prompt engineering, robust RAG pipelines).\n*   **Data Store Simulation:** The in-memory data stores lack persistence, concurrency handling, and real database performance characteristics.\n\n## Security Assessment\n\n**Critical Issues (Currently Simulated/Missing Implementations):**\n*   **Hardcoded Sensitive Information:** Placeholder API keys and database URLs in `config.py` require replacement with environment variables or, ideally, a secure secrets manager (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) in production.\n*   **Lack of Robust Data Security for Data Stores:** The in-memory data stores currently offer no persistence, access control, or encryption at rest/in transit. This is a severe vulnerability in a multi-user or networked environment.\n*   **LLM Prompt Injection and Data Leakage:** While conceptual mitigation is in place, the framework currently lacks robust input sanitization and output validation for LLM interactions to prevent prompt injection attacks or unintended data exposure (e.g., PII being sent to external LLMs).\n*   **Insecure Inter-Service Communication:** The simulated `MessageBroker` lacks authentication, authorization, and encryption for messages, which are critical for protecting data in transit in a microservices environment.\n*   **Insufficient Data Cleansing and Sanitization:** The data processing service performs basic cleansing. In a real system, more advanced sanitization for malicious scripts or PII is required.\n*   **Potential for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Report Generation:** If reports are rendered in a web browser, the current string concatenation for report content could be vulnerable to XSS without proper output encoding/escaping.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n1.  **Implement Robust Secrets Management:** Transition all sensitive credentials to secure environment variables and a secrets management solution.\n2.  **Adopt Production-Grade Data Stores:** Replace all in-memory data stores with secure, persistent, and scalable solutions (e.g., managed databases with encryption and RBAC).\n3.  **Fortify LLM Interactions:** Implement comprehensive input sanitization for prompts, strict output validation and moderation, and PII anonymization before sending data to LLMs. Leverage frameworks like Guardrails AI or LangChain for this.\n4.  **Secure Inter-Service Communication:** Utilize a production-ready message broker configured with TLS for encryption in transit and strong access controls.\n5.  **Implement Comprehensive Data Sanitization:** Enhance the data processing service with more advanced techniques for cleaning, validating, and anonymizing data.\n6.  **Protect Report Output from XSS:** Ensure all dynamic content in reports is properly HTML-escaped if rendered in a web context, or use secure document generation libraries for other formats.\n7.  **Enhance Logging, Monitoring, and Alerting:** Establish a centralized logging system, monitor for security-relevant events, and set up alerts for suspicious activities.\n\n## Performance Characteristics\n\n**Current Limitations (Due to Simulation):**\n*   **In-Memory Data Stores:** The primary bottleneck. Data processing and storage are limited by available RAM, preventing handling of large data volumes and offering no persistence.\n*   **Synchronous Orchestration (Conceptual):** While `async/await` is used, the orchestrator still conceptually steps through services sequentially for demonstration. A real asynchronous system would process stages in parallel more extensively via message queues.\n*   **Dummy LLM Calls and RAG:** The mocked LLM responses and naive RAG implementation do not reflect the high latency and computational intensity of real LLM inference and efficient vector search.\n\n**Optimization Opportunities (Future Implementations):**\n*   **Replace In-Memory Data Stores:** Transition to persistent, high-performance databases (S3, PostgreSQL, Pinecone, Redis) for significant I/O and scalability improvements.\n*   **True Asynchronous Processing:** Refactor the message broker and service consumers to truly operate asynchronously in separate processes/tasks via a real message queue. This enables maximum parallelization and responsiveness.\n*   **Optimized LLM & RAG Integration:** Integrate real LLM APIs with asynchronous clients (`httpx`), implement efficient embedding models, and leverage vector database's optimized ANN search algorithms for low-latency RAG.\n*   **Caching Strategy:** Implement comprehensive caching for LLM responses and frequently accessed data to reduce redundant computations and API calls.\n*   **Resource Optimization:** Monitor CPU/memory usage, especially during data processing and embedding generation. Consider distributed processing frameworks for very large datasets if single-node performance is insufficient.\n\n## Known Limitations\n\n*   **Simulated External Services:** The current implementation uses in-memory simulations for all external dependencies: LLM APIs, data sources, databases (Data Lake, Data Warehouse, Vector Database, Cache, Metadata DB), and the message broker. This allows for quick setup and demonstration but means the system is not production-ready in terms of persistence, concurrency, scalability, security, or real-world performance.\n*   **Limited Data Sources:** Data ingestion is currently mocked. Integration with diverse, real-world data sources (e.g., live news APIs, social media streams, proprietary market data platforms) requires significant development.\n*   **Basic LLM Integration:** The LLM responses are hardcoded. A full implementation requires advanced prompt engineering, handling LLM specific nuances (context window, token limits, rate limits, cost), and robust response parsing.\n*   **Simplified Report Formatting:** The \"Gartner-style\" formatting is currently basic Markdown. Production-grade reports would require dedicated document generation libraries (e.g., for PDF, DOCX) and sophisticated templating for charts and complex layouts.\n*   **No User Interface:** The framework is currently backend-only. A user-friendly interface would be required for broader usability.\n```\n\n### Changelog\n```markdown\n# Changelog\n\n## Version History\n\n### 1.0.0 - Initial Refactored Version (Current)\n*   **Features:**\n    *   Implemented core LLM-guided market research report generation framework.\n    *   Modular microservices architecture with conceptual event-driven design.\n    *   Asynchronous processing using Python's `asyncio` for improved concurrency.\n    *   Structured data handling with Pydantic models.\n    *   Conceptualized data ingestion, processing, market analysis, LLM orchestration (with RAG), and report generation services.\n    *   Basic in-memory data store simulations.\n    *   Granular custom error handling.\n    *   Comprehensive logging.\n    *   Initial suite of unit tests.\n\n## Breaking Changes\n\n*   **Asynchronous API:** All core service methods and the `ReportOrchestrator.generate_report` method are now `async` functions. Direct synchronous calls are no longer supported. The `main` execution block now requires `asyncio.run()`.\n*   **Environment Variables for Secrets:** Sensitive configuration values (e.g., `LLM_API_KEY`, `SOCIAL_MEDIA_API_KEY`) are no longer hardcoded in `src/modules/config.py`. They *must* be provided via environment variables or a `.env` file.\n*   **Custom Error Hierarchy:** The generic `CustomError` has been replaced by a more specific hierarchy of exceptions (e.g., `DataIngestionError`, `LLMGenerationError`, `ReportAssemblyError`), requiring updates to `try-except` blocks if you were catching the old `CustomError`.\n*   **Test Runner Update:** Unit tests now use `unittest.IsolatedAsyncioTestCase` for proper asynchronous test execution.\n\n## Migration Guides\n\nTo migrate an existing setup or implement this framework:\n\n1.  **Update Python Environment:** Ensure you are running Python 3.7+ (preferably 3.9+) to leverage `async/await`.\n2.  **Install/Update Dependencies:**\n    ```bash\n    pip install pydantic pydantic-settings\n    ```\n3.  **Replace Source Code:** Overwrite your existing `src/` and `tests/` directories with the refactored code provided.\n4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**\n    *   Create or update your `.env` file in the project root.\n    *   Define `LLM_API_KEY`, `SOCIAL_MEDIA_API_KEY`, and `DATABASE_URL` as required.\n    *   **Example `.env`:**\n        ```dotenv\n        LLM_API_KEY=\"your_actual_llm_api_key\"\n        SOCIAL_MEDIA_API_KEY=\"your_actual_social_media_api_key\"\n        DATABASE_URL=\"sqlite:///./app.db\"\n        ```\n5.  **Adjust Application Entry Point:**\n    *   If you have a custom entry point, ensure it uses `asyncio.run()` to invoke the `ReportOrchestrator.generate_report` method.\n    *   The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block in `src/main.py` serves as an example.\n6.  **Update Test Files:**\n    *   Ensure all your test classes inherit from `unittest.IsolatedAsyncioTestCase`.\n    *   Update any mock objects to `unittest.mock.AsyncMock()` for asynchronous methods.\n    *   Replace `assert_called_once_with` with `assert_awaited_once_with` and similar `assert_awaited` methods.\n7.  **Transition to Real Components (Future):**\n    *   This refactoring lays the groundwork for using real databases, message brokers, and LLM APIs. When moving to production, replace the simulated methods in `src/modules/data_stores.py`, `src/modules/message_broker.py`, and `src/modules/llm_orchestration_service.py` with actual client library calls (e.g., `aiopg` for PostgreSQL, `httpx` for external APIs, `aiokafka` for Kafka, etc.). This will involve adding new `pip` dependencies.\n```",
