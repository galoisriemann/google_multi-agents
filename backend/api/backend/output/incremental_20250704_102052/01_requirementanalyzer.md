### Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance Requirements**:
    *   **Response Time**: Report generation for standard queries should be completed within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., minutes to hours, depending on complexity and data volume).
    *   **Data Processing Speed**: The system must efficiently process and analyze large volumes of data from various sources.
    *   **Update Latency**: Continuous updates should ensure data freshness with minimal latency for critical real-time signals (e.g., social media).
*   **Security Requirements**:
    *   **Data Privacy**: All collected data, especially sensitive customer-specific information (customer interactions, sales trends), must be protected through encryption and access controls. Compliance with relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) is essential.
    *   **Access Control**: Role-based access control (RBAC) should be implemented to ensure only authorized users can access specific data sets or generate certain types of reports.
    *   **LLM Security**: Measures to prevent prompt injection attacks or data leakage through LLM interactions.
*   **Scalability Requirements**:
    *   **Data Volume Scalability**: The framework must be capable of handling an ever-increasing volume of data from diverse sources without degradation in performance.
    *   **User Scalability**: The system should support a growing number of concurrent users and report requests.
    *   **Computational Scalability**: The underlying infrastructure for LLMs and data processing must be scalable to handle increasing computational demands.
*   **Usability Requirements**:
    *   **Intuitive Interface**: The LLM-guided interaction should be natural and easy to use for specifying research requirements.
    *   **Report Readability**: Generated reports must be clear, concise, and easy to understand for business users and executives.
    *   **Documentation**: Comprehensive and clear documentation for implementation, usage, and maintenance is required, following best practices outlined in `coding_standards.docx` (e.g., PEP 257 for docstrings, good project organization).

### Technical Constraints

*   **Technology Stack Preferences**: The framework should leverage Large Language Models (LLMs). Python is strongly implied as a preferred language given the `coding_standards.docx` which heavily focuses on Python best practices (PEP 8, PEP 20, PEP 257, type hints, virtual environments).
*   **Platform Constraints**: Not explicitly stated, but cloud-native deployment (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure) is recommended for scalability and LLM integration.
*   **Integration Requirements**:
    *   API-based integration with external data sources (e.g., market databases, social media platforms, SEC APIs).
    *   Potential integration with internal CRM or sales data systems for personalization.
    *   Tools for automated documentation generation (e.g., Sphinx, Read The Docs as mentioned in `coding_standards.docx`) should be considered.
    *   Version control system (e.g., Git) for code management, as highlighted in `coding_standards.docx`.
    *   Use of virtual environments (`pipenv`, `conda`) for dependency management, as per `coding_standards.docx`.

### Assumptions and Clarifications

*   **LLM Choice**: Is there a preference for a specific LLM (e.g., proprietary, open-source)? Will the LLM be fine-tuned or used off-the-shelf?
*   **Data Source Access**: Are APIs or direct data feeds available for all listed data sources (Nielsen, Kantar, SEC filings, etc.)? Are there any associated licensing costs for these data sources?
*   **Definition of "Gartner-style"**: While examples are provided in `test_ppt.pptx`, a clearer definition of specific formatting, depth of analysis, and visual elements expected in a "Gartner-style" report would be beneficial.
*   **Personalization Scope**: What is the exact scope and sensitivity of "customer interactions, sales trends, and marketing outreach" data for personalization? How will this data be ingested and secured?
*   **Update Frequency**: What is the desired frequency for "continuous updates" for different data types (e.g., real-time for social media, daily/weekly for market news, quarterly for SEC filings)?
*   **User Interaction Model**: Beyond natural language input, will there be a UI for configuring reports, viewing progress, or reviewing outputs?
*   **Reporting Granularity**: What level of detail is expected in the reports (e.g., global, regional, country-specific, specific product lines)?
*   **Budget**: What is the budget for LLM API costs, data source subscriptions, and infrastructure?

### Risk Assessment

*   **Technical Risks**:
    *   **LLM Accuracy and Hallucination**: LLMs can generate incorrect or fabricated information.
        *   *Mitigation*: Implement robust validation mechanisms for LLM outputs (e.g., fact-checking against source data, human review for critical sections). Employ Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ground LLM responses in verifiable data.
    *   **Data Quality and Freshness**: Reliance on diverse external data sources can lead to issues with data quality, consistency, and freshness.
        *   *Mitigation*: Implement data validation pipelines, establish SLAs with data providers, and set up continuous monitoring for data ingestion.
    *   **Integration Complexity**: Integrating with numerous disparate data sources, especially those without well-documented APIs, can be challenging and time-consuming.
        *   *Mitigation*: Prioritize data sources, use flexible integration patterns (e.g., ETL tools, microservices), and develop robust error handling.
    *   **Computational Cost**: Running large-scale LLM inferences and processing vast amounts of data can be computationally expensive.
        *   *Mitigation*: Optimize LLM usage (e.g., prompt engineering, caching), explore cost-effective LLM providers, and leverage scalable cloud infrastructure.
    *   **Model Bias**: LLMs can inherit biases from their training data, potentially leading to skewed or unfair market analyses.
        *   *Mitigation*: Regularly audit LLM outputs for bias, diversify training data if fine-tuning, and implement fairness metrics.
*   **Operational Risks**:
    *   **Maintenance Overhead**: Managing and updating numerous data integrations and LLM models can lead to significant maintenance overhead.
        *   *Mitigation*: Automate data pipelines and deployment processes. Adhere to modular design and comprehensive documentation (`coding_standards.docx`).
    *   **Dependency on Third-Party APIs/Models**: Reliance on external APIs or LLM providers introduces dependencies that could impact system availability or performance.
        *   *Mitigation*: Implement fallback mechanisms, monitor third-party service health, and consider multi-provider strategies.
*   **Business Risks**:
    *   **Misleading Insights**: Inaccurate or biased reports could lead to poor business decisions.
        *   *Mitigation*: Emphasize human oversight for critical reports, provide transparency on data sources and LLM confidence scores, and continuously improve the framework based on feedback.
    *   **Intellectual Property and Data Confidentiality**: Handling sensitive market data and proprietary customer information requires strict adherence to legal and ethical guidelines.
        *   *Mitigation*: Implement strong data governance policies, legal reviews, and robust security measures.
