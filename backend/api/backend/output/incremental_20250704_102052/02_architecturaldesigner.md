## System Architecture Design

### High-Level Architecture

The system is designed as a **hybrid microservices and event-driven architecture**, leveraging a **Clean Architecture** pattern within individual services, particularly for LLM orchestration and report generation. This approach ensures modularity, scalability, and maintainability, allowing for independent development, deployment, and scaling of components.

**Overall System Design:**

The core idea is an LLM-orchestrated pipeline that ingests diverse data, performs advanced analysis and synthesis, and generates comprehensive Gartner-style market research reports.

**Architecture Pattern Details:**

*   **Microservices:** Each core functional area (e.g., Data Source Connectors, specific Analysis modules, Report Generation) is encapsulated as an independent service. This promotes loose coupling, independent deployment, and enables scaling specific bottlenecks.
*   **Event-Driven:** A central Event Bus facilitates asynchronous communication between services. This is crucial for:
    *   Triggering data ingestion upon discovery of new data.
    *   Orchestrating complex workflows (e.g., a report request triggering multiple analysis tasks in parallel).
    *   Enabling continuous updates and real-time data processing.
*   **Clean Architecture (within Services):** Services are structured into layers (Domain, Application, Infrastructure) to maintain separation of concerns, enforce business rules, and make the system testable and maintainable.
*   **Domain-Driven Design (DDD):** The core business domains (e.g., "Industry Analysis," "Market Trend," "Report") are modeled explicitly, driving the design of service boundaries and data structures.

### Component Design

Each component is designed with a clear responsibility, well-defined interfaces, and adheres to the principles of modularity and single responsibility.

**Core Components and Their Responsibilities:**

1.  **User Interface / API Gateway:**
    *   **Responsibility:** Provides the entry point for users, handling natural language input for report requests. Acts as an API gateway for external integrations and internal service routing, managing authentication and authorization.
    *   **Interfaces:** RESTful API endpoints (e.g., `/reports/generate`, `/data/sources`), GraphQL for flexible queries.
    *   **Data Flow:** User input (natural language request) -> API Gateway -> LLM Orchestration Service.

2.  **LLM Orchestration Service:**
    *   **Responsibility:** The intelligent core. Interprets user's natural language request (prompt engineering), breaks it down into sub-tasks (e.g., "get industry data," "analyze competitive landscape," "predict market trends"), manages conversation state, selects appropriate LLM models, and orchestrates the entire report generation workflow by dispatching tasks to other services via the Event Bus. Manages RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) by querying the Knowledge Graph/Analytical Data Store to ground LLM responses in factual data and prevent hallucination.
    *   **Interfaces:**
        *   `orchestrate_report_request(user_prompt: str, user_context: dict) -> report_id`
        *   `generate_llm_response(prompt: str, context: dict, model_params: dict) -> str`
        *   Emits events to Event Bus (e.g., `data.ingest.request`, `analysis.industry.request`).
        *   Consumes events from Event Bus (e.g., `analysis.industry.complete`).
    *   **Data Flow:** User Request -> Decomposed Tasks -> Event Bus & Direct Service Calls. Receives analysis results, synthesizes them using LLM, and passes to Report Generation.

        *   **Interfaces:** `transform_and_load(raw_data_path: str, schema_id: str) -> Event` (emits `harmonized.data.available` event).
        *   **Data Flow:** Data Lake -> Transformation Service -> Knowledge Graph & Analytical Data Store.
    *   **d. Knowledge Graph:**
        *   **Responsibility:** Stores entities, relationships, and facts extracted from harmonized data. Crucial for providing structured context to LLMs (RAG) and enabling sophisticated semantic queries for analysis.
        *   **Data Flow:** Data Transformation -> Knowledge Graph. Queried by Analysis Services and LLM Orchestration.
    *   **e. Analytical Data Store (Data Warehouse/Vector DB):**
        *   **Responsibility:** Stores harmonized, structured data optimized for analytical queries (e.g., market size, growth rates, company financials) and vector embeddings of text for semantic search and RAG.
        *   **Data Flow:** Data Transformation -> Analytical Data Store. Queried by Analysis Services.

4.  **Analysis & Insight Generation Services (LLM-Powered):**
    *   **a. Industry & Competitive Analysis Service:**
        *   **Responsibility:** Analyzes specific industries and maps competitive landscapes. Identifies key players, market shares, strategies, strengths/weaknesses (SWOT). Leverages LLM for qualitative synthesis and interpretation of structured/unstructured data from the Knowledge Graph and Analytical Data Store.

### Design Patterns

*   **Architectural Patterns:**
    *   **Microservices Architecture:** Decomposing the system into small, independently deployable services.
    *   **Event-Driven Architecture:** Utilizing an event bus for asynchronous communication and decoupled service interactions, enabling reactive and scalable workflows.
    *   **Clean Architecture/Hexagonal Architecture:** Applied within individual services to separate core business logic (Domain) from application logic and infrastructure concerns. This enhances testability, maintainability, and portability.
    *   **Repository Pattern:** Abstracting data access logic from the domain models, allowing for flexible storage choices and easier testing.
    *   **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):** Potentially for complex analytical queries where reads and writes have different scaling and modeling needs, allowing separate optimized models.

*   **Design Patterns for Implementation:**
    *   **Strategy Pattern:** For different data transformation logic, LLM model choices, or report formatting strategies.
    *   **Factory Pattern:** For creating instances of specific data source connectors or analytical models based on configuration.
    *   **Observer Pattern:** Implicit in the event-driven architecture, where services subscribe to relevant events.
    *   **Adapter Pattern:** For integrating with various external data source APIs, normalizing their diverse interfaces into a consistent format.
    *   **Facade Pattern:** Providing a simplified interface to a complex subsystem (e.g., the LLM Orchestration Service as a facade over various LLM and analysis interactions).
    *   **Builder Pattern:** For constructing complex report documents from various insights and formatting elements.
    *   **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):** A critical pattern for LLM interaction, ensuring that LLM responses are grounded in factual, relevant data from the Knowledge Graph and Analytical Data Store to mitigate hallucination.
    *   **Agentic Workflows:** For complex LLM tasks, where the LLM acts as an "agent" capable of using tools (e.g., calling analysis services, querying databases) to achieve a goal.

### Quality Attributes
