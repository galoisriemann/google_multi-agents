## Requirements Analysis

### Functional Requirements
- **LLM-Guided Report Generation:** The framework must generate comprehensive Gartner-style market research reports, leveraging an LLM for data processing, insight extraction, and content generation.
- **Modular Report Content:** The generated reports must include distinct, self-contained sections:
    - Industry analysis and competitive landscape mapping.
    - Market trends identification and future predictions.
    - Technology adoption analysis and recommendations.
    - Strategic insights and actionable recommendations.
    - Executive summary with key findings.
- **Customizable Research Scope:** Users must be able to define specific research requirements, such as industry, competitor, or market segment, to generate focused and relevant reports.
- **Automated Data Aggregation:** The framework shall automatically collect and aggregate data from diverse sources, including but not limited to:
    - Industry news and publications.
    - Company reports (e.g., annual reports, investor presentations).
    - SEC filings (e.g., 10-K, 10-Q).
    - Commercial market databases.
    - Academic research papers.
    - Primary research sources (e.g., Nielsen, Kantar).
    - Real-time social media signals.
- **Continuous Market Monitoring and Updates:** The system must continuously monitor market developments and automatically integrate new data to ensure reports remain current and reflect real-time industry changes.
- **Insight Extraction and Synthesis:** The LLM component shall process collected data to extract key insights, identify market patterns, and analyze correlations between data points to provide comprehensive market intelligence.
- **Personalized Action Items:** The framework should be capable of deriving customer-specific action items based on relevant inputs such as customer interactions, sales trends, and marketing outreach.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance Requirements:**
    - Report generation time should be optimized to provide timely insights, ideally within minutes for standard requests, and within a few hours for complex, comprehensive analyses.
    - Data ingestion and processing pipelines must support near real-time updates for continuous monitoring.
- **Security Requirements:**
    - All data, especially proprietary or sensitive market intelligence, must be encrypted both in transit and at rest.
    - Role-based access control (RBAC) should be implemented to ensure only authorized users can access specific reports or data.
    - Adherence to relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) must be ensured.
- **Scalability Requirements:**
    - The architecture must be designed to scale horizontally to accommodate increasing data volumes, more frequent updates, and a growing number of report generation requests.
    - The LLM integration should support scaling to handle increased query loads.
- **Usability Requirements:**
    - The user interface for specifying research parameters and retrieving reports should be intuitive and user-friendly.
    - Generated reports should be well-structured, easy to navigate, and presented in a professional, "Gartner-style" format.

### Technical Constraints
- **Technology Stack Preferences:**
    - **Programming Language:** Python is the preferred programming language, aligning with best practices outlined in `coding_standards.docx` (PEP 8, PEP 20, PEP 257).
    - **LLM Integration:** The framework will require robust API integrations with a chosen Large Language Model.
    - **Data Storage:** A scalable database solution (e.g., NoSQL for flexibility, or a data warehouse for analytical queries) will be necessary for storing aggregated data and generated insights.
- **Platform Constraints:**
    - The solution should ideally be cloud-agnostic or at least designed for deployment on major cloud platforms (e.g., GCP, AWS, Azure) to leverage their scalable services.
- **Integration Requirements:**
    - The system must integrate with various external data sources (e.g., news APIs, financial data APIs, social media APIs, web scraping tools).
    - Version control systems (specifically Git) are mandatory for code management and collaboration, as emphasized in `coding_standards.docx`.
    - Virtual environments must be used for dependency management to prevent conflicts and ensure reproducibility.

### Assumptions and Clarifications
- **Assumptions Made:**
    - A suitable Large Language Model with robust capabilities for text analysis, summarization, and content generation will be available and accessible.
    - Necessary APIs or data access mechanisms for various external data sources (e.g., news, SEC filings, market data) are available for integration.
    - The definition of "Gartner-style" report implies a focus on actionable insights, robust data analysis, clear visual representation (though not explicitly requested, implied by "Gartner-style"), and a professional tone.
- **Questions that Need Clarification:**
    - What specific LLM model(s) are being considered for integration, and what are their estimated operational costs?
    - What is the expected refresh rate for "real-time" updates (e.g., hourly, daily, continuous streaming)?
    - Are there specific compliance or regulatory requirements beyond general data privacy (e.g., industry-specific certifications)?
    - What are the target user roles and their technical proficiency levels?
    - What are the specific requirements for report output formats (e.g., PDF, interactive dashboards, editable documents)?

### Risk Assessment
- **Potential Technical Risks:**
    - **LLM Hallucinations/Inaccuracy:** Large Language Models can occasionally generate factually incorrect or nonsensical information, compromising report quality.
    - **Data Quality and Availability Issues:** Incomplete, inaccurate, or unavailable data from external sources can lead to flawed analysis and insights.
    - **Scalability Bottlenecks:** Processing and analyzing vast amounts of real-time data, combined with concurrent report generation, could lead to performance bottlenecks if not architected correctly.
    - **Integration Complexity:** Integrating with numerous disparate external data sources, each with its own API and data structure, can be complex and time-consuming.
    - **Cost Overruns:** Extensive LLM usage and large-scale data processing can incur significant operational costs if not optimized.
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **For LLM Hallucinations:** Implement a multi-stage validation process including cross-referencing insights with verified data, incorporating human-in-the-loop review for critical sections, and fine-tuning the LLM on domain-specific, high-quality datasets.
    - **For Data Quality and Availability:** Implement robust data validation checks at ingestion, establish clear data lineage, diversify data sources to reduce single points of failure, and implement comprehensive error handling for data retrieval.
    - **For Scalability Bottlenecks:** Design a microservices-based architecture for modularity, utilize cloud-native scalable services (e.g., serverless functions, managed databases), and implement asynchronous processing for data pipelines.
    - **For Integration Complexity:** Use standardized data formats (e.g., JSON, Avro) for internal data transfer, develop reusable data connectors, and prioritize API-first integrations over web scraping where possible.
    - **For Cost Overruns:** Optimize LLM prompts for efficiency, explore token-usage monitoring and cost-effective LLM models, implement data caching mechanisms, and use spot instances or reserved instances for cloud resources where appropriate.
