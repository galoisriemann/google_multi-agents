It signals the Data Ingestion & Curation Service to gather relevant data based on the report scope.\n4.  **Data Collection:** Data Ingestion & Curation Service fetches data from External and Internal Data Sources, processes it, and stores it in the Data Lake. It then publishes a `data_ingested` event to the Message Bus.\n5.  **Analysis Trigger:** The Analysis & Synthesis Service subscribes to `data_ingested` events. Upon receiving, it retrieves the curated data.\n6.  **LLM Processing:** Analysis & Synthesis Service makes multiple calls to the LLM Orchestrator Service, providing data snippets and carefully engineered prompts to perform specific analyses (e.g., SWOT, trend identification). The LLM Orchestrator interacts with various LLM Providers.\n7.  **Analysis Completion:** Once analyses are complete, the Analysis & Synthesis Service stores the structured insights in the Data Lake and publishes an `analysis_complete` event.\n8.  **Personalization (Concurrent/Sequential):** The Orchestration Service may also trigger the Personalization Service to generate specific customer-centric recommendations using internal data. It publishes `personalization_complete` event.\n9.  **Report Assembly:** The Report Generation Service subscribes to `analysis_complete` (and `personalization_complete`) events. It retrieves all relevant insights from the Data Lake and uses pre-defined templates and styling rules to compile the final report.\n10. **Report Delivery:** The generated report is stored in the Generated Reports Storage, and a notification is sent back to the Orchestration Service, which then updates the report status for the UI. The user can then retrieve the report via the API Gateway.\n11. **Continuous Monitoring:** The Continuous Monitoring Service constantly observes data sources. If new relevant data is detected, it triggers the Data Ingestion & Curation Service, which may lead to re-triggering the entire analysis and report generation process for affected reports.\n\n### Technology Stack\n\n*   **Programming Languages and Frameworks:**\n    *   **Backend Services:** Python 3.9+ (Mandatory).\n    *   **Web Frameworks:** FastAPI (for high performance, async support, and automatic OpenAPI documentation) or Flask (for smaller services).\n    *   **Asynchronous I/O:** `asyncio` for non-blocking operations, `httpx` for async HTTP requests.\n    *   **Data Processing:** `Pandas`, `Polars` (for high-performance data manipulation), `Numpy`.\n    *   **LLM Interaction:** `LangChain`, `LlamaIndex` (for prompt orchestration, RAG, agentic workflows), specific LLM provider SDKs (e.g., OpenAI API, Anthropic API, Hugging Face `transformers`).\n    *   **Data Validation:** `Pydantic` for data model definition and validation, especially for API contracts.\n    *   **Background Tasks:** `Celery` with Redis/RabbitMQ backend for long-running or scheduled tasks.\n    *   **Testing:** `Pytest`.\n*   **Databases and Storage Solutions:**\n    *   **Relational Database:** PostgreSQL (for user metadata, report metadata, system configuration, audit logs – ensures ACID properties).\n    *   **Document Database:** MongoDB or Couchbase (for flexible storage of raw ingested data, semi-structured analytical outputs).\n    *   **Vector Database:** Pinecone, Weaviate, or ChromaDB (for storing embeddings used in RAG for LLM context retrieval).\n    *   **Object Storage:** AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage (for storing large raw data files, generated reports, LLM model artifacts).\n    *   **Data Lake:** Apache Iceberg or Delta Lake on top of object storage for structured data warehousing and query optimization.\n*   **Infrastructure and Deployment Considerations:**\n    *   **Cloud Provider:** AWS, Azure, or GCP (e.g., AWS ECS/EKS for container orchestration, Azure Kubernetes Service, Google Kubernetes Engine).\n    *   **Containerization:** Docker for packaging microservices.\n    *   **Orchestration:** Kubernetes (K8s) for managing, scaling, and deploying containerized applications.\n    *   **Message Broker:** Apache Kafka (for high-throughput, fault-tolerant event streaming) or RabbitMQ (for simpler message queuing).\n    *   **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins (for automated testing, building, and deployment).\n    *   **Observability:** Prometheus/Grafana (for monitoring), ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Datadog (for centralized logging and tracing).\n    *   **API Management:** AWS API Gateway, Azure API Management, Apigee (if specific features beyond basic routing are needed).\n\n### Design Patterns\n\n*   **Architectural Patterns:**\n    *   **Microservices Architecture:** Decouples the system into small, independent, deployable services.
