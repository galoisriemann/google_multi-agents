    *   It shall perform correlation analysis between different data points to generate comprehensive market intelligence.
*   **Market Research Report Generation:**
    *   The system shall generate comprehensive market research reports in a "Gartner-style" format.
    *   The reports must include the following distinct sections:
        *   Industry analysis and competitive landscape mapping.
        *   Market trends identification and future predictions.
        *   Technology adoption analysis and recommendations.
        *   Strategic insights and actionable recommendations.
        *   An executive summary with key findings.
*   **Custom Report Specification:**
    *   Users shall be able to specify research requirements based on criteria such as industry, competitor, or market segment.
    *   The system shall generate focused reports tailored to the specified requirements, including relevant metrics and competitive analyses.
*   **Personalization Capabilities:**
    *   The framework shall derive customer-specific action items by analyzing inputs such as customer interactions, sales trends, and marketing outreach data.
*   **Continuous Updates:**
    *   The AI agent shall continuously monitor market developments and automatically incorporate new data into existing reports to ensure they remain current with real-time industry changes.

### Non-Functional Requirements
*   **Performance requirements:**
    *   Reports should be generated within an acceptable timeframe, with specific targets to be defined (e.g., X minutes for a standard report, Y seconds for minor updates).
    *   Data ingestion and processing pipelines must be efficient to handle real-time data streams.
*   **Security requirements:**
    *   All data aggregation, storage, and processing must comply with relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
    *   Sensitive market data and user-specific inputs must be secured through encryption and robust access controls.
    *   Measures to prevent data leakage and unauthorized access to LLM outputs are required.
*   **Scalability requirements:**
    *   The framework must be scalable to handle increasing volumes of data from diverse sources.
    *   It should support a growing number of report generation requests and user queries without significant degradation in performance.
    *   The LLM inference capabilities must be scalable to accommodate complex analyses and multiple concurrent tasks.
*   **Usability requirements:**
    *   The interface for defining research requirements and accessing generated reports should be intuitive and user-friendly, potentially leveraging natural language processing for input.
    *   The generated reports should be clear, concise, and easy to understand for business stakeholders.
*   **Modularity:**
    *   The framework components (e.g., data collection, analysis, report generation, personalization, continuous updates) must be designed as independent, reusable modules.
*   **Maintainability:**
    *   The codebase must be well-structured, follow established coding standards (e.g., PEP 8, PEP 20, PEP 257 as per `coding_standards.docx`), and be easily maintainable by developers.
*   **Documentation:**
    *   Comprehensive and detailed documentation for setup, implementation, usage, and maintenance of the framework must be provided, including API documentation, module descriptions, and usage examples.

### Technical Constraints
*   **Technology Stack:**
    *   Primary development language for the framework components is Python, adhering to PEP 8, PEP 20, and PEP 257 coding standards for style, readability, and docstring conventions.
*   **LLM Integration:**
    *   The framework requires integration with one or more external Large Language Model APIs or self-hosted LLM solutions.
*   **Data Storage:**
    *   A scalable and performant data storage solution (e.g., a data lake, data warehouse, or NoSQL database) will be required to store aggregated market data.
*   **Version Control:**
    *   The entire project codebase must be managed using Git for version control, ensuring collaboration and change tracking.
*   **Dependency Management:**
    *   Python virtual environments (e.g., `venv` or `conda`) must be used to manage project dependencies. A `requirements.txt` file (as mentioned in `coding_standards.docx`) will define all project dependencies.
*   **Documentation Generation:**
    *   Tools like Sphinx and Read the Docs are preferred for generating automated, comprehensive project documentation.
*   **Development Environment:**
    *   Development should utilize IDEs with built-in PEP 8 inspection (e.g., PyCharm) or command-line linting tools (e.g., Pylint, Flake8).

### Assumptions and Clarifications
*   **LLM Model Selection:** What specific LLM model(s) (e.g., OpenAI GPT series, Google Gemini, open-source models like Llama) are preferred for integration? This choice impacts capabilities, cost, and deployment.
*   **Report Output Format:** What is the exact desired output format for the "Gartner-style" report (e.g., PDF document, interactive web dashboard, Word document)?
*   **Level of Automation vs. Human-in-the-Loop:** To what extent will human review and intervention be required in the LLM-guided report generation process (e.g., for fact-checking, prompt refinement, or final editorial review)?
*   **Data Source Access:** Are APIs or direct access available for all specified data sources (e.g., Nielsen, Kantar, SEC filings, social media streams)? Are there any limitations or costs associated with accessing these sources?
*   **Definition of "Real-time":** What is the precise definition of "real-time" for continuous updates (e.g., minutes, hours, daily, weekly)?
*   **Scope of Personalization Data:** What is the scope and sensitivity of "customer interactions, sales trends, and marketing outreach" data for personalization? How will this data be provided and secured?

### Risk Assessment
*   **Potential technical risks:**
    *   **LLM Hallucinations and Factual Inaccuracy:** LLMs may generate plausible but factually incorrect or misleading information, impacting report reliability.
    *   **Data Quality and Bias:** Reports may be skewed if input data is incomplete, biased, or of poor quality.
    *   **Computational Cost and Resource Management:** Running advanced LLMs and processing large datasets can incur significant computational costs and require substantial resources.
    *   **Integration Complexity:** Integrating diverse data sources with different schemas and APIs, along with LLM APIs, can be technically challenging.
    *   **Performance Bottlenecks:** Real-time data processing and continuous updates for large datasets might lead to performance issues if not optimized.
*   **Mitigation strategies:**
    *   **LLM Hallucinations:** Implement fact-checking mechanisms, integrate with curated knowledge bases, allow for human review and validation of critical insights, and use prompt engineering techniques to reduce hallucination.
    *   **Data Quality:** Establish robust data validation, cleansing, and curation processes. Prioritize reputable data sources and implement data lineage tracking.
    *   **Cost and Resource Management:** Optimize LLM usage (e.g., efficient prompting, batch processing), explore cost-effective LLM models or APIs, and leverage cloud-native services for scalable resource allocation.
    *   **Integration Complexity:** Design a modular architecture with clear API contracts for each data source and service. Use established data integration patterns and robust error handling.
    *   **Performance:** Implement efficient data pipelines, consider parallel processing for data ingestion and analysis, use caching strategies, and optimize LLM calls for speed.
    *   **Security and Privacy:** Enforce strict access controls, data encryption (at rest and in transit), anonymization of sensitive data where possible, and ensure compliance with data protection regulations.
    *   **Maintenance:** Strictly adhere to the coding standards, ensure comprehensive documentation, implement automated testing (unit, integration, end-to-end), and establish a clear deployment and maintenance roadmap.
    *   **Ethical Considerations:** Develop and adhere to ethical AI guidelines, monitor for biases in generated reports, and ensure transparency about the LLM's role in content generation.
