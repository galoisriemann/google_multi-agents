### Design Patterns

**Architectural Patterns:**

*   **Microservices Architecture:** Decomposes the application into small, independent, loosely coupled services.
*   **Event-Driven Architecture:** Services communicate asynchronously via events published to a message broker, enabling loose coupling and scalability.
*   **API Gateway:** A single entry point for all client requests, providing unified access and security.
*   **Data Lakehouse:** Combines the flexibility and low cost of a data lake with the structure and query capabilities of a data warehouse.
*   **Clean Architecture (within services):** Organizes code into layers (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Presentation) to enforce separation of concerns, making code testable and maintainable.

**Design Patterns (within microservices):**

*   **Repository Pattern:** Abstracts data access logic, making services independent of specific database technologies.
*   **Strategy Pattern:** Allows selection of different algorithms at runtime, e.g., for various LLM providers, data sources, or report formats.
*   **Factory Pattern:** Creates objects of different types based on input, e.g., for different report output formats or LLM model instances.
*   **Observer Pattern:** Used by the Continuous Monitoring Service to react to events from other services (e.g., new data ingested).
*   **Command Pattern:** Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing for parameterization, queuing, and logging of requests (e.g., report generation requests).
*   **Saga Pattern (Choreography/Orchestration):** To manage distributed transactions across multiple services for complex workflows like report generation, ensuring consistency despite failures.
*   **Circuit Breaker:** Prevents cascading failures when interacting with external APIs (e.g., LLM providers, external data sources).
*   **Retry Pattern:** Automatically retries transient failures in external calls or database operations.
*   **Builder Pattern:** For constructing complex objects, such as elaborate LLM prompts with multiple context segments.
*   **Chain of Responsibility:** For processing LLM prompts through a sequence of steps (e.g., pre-processing, RAG, prompt formatting).
*   **Façade Pattern:** Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem (e.g., the LLM Inference Service could provide a façade over various LLM provider APIs).

### Quality Attributes

**1. Scalability:**
*   **Microservices:** Each service can be scaled independently based on its specific load requirements (e.g., LLM Inference Service might need more GPU resources than Report Management Service).
*   **Cloud-Native Services:** Leveraging managed services (e.g., S3, RDS, EKS/AKS/GKE, Kafka) provides inherent scalability and reduces operational overhead.
*   **Asynchronous Processing & Message Queues:** Decouples services, allowing them to process messages at their own pace, absorbing spikes in load and providing resilience.
*   **Containerization & Orchestration (Kubernetes):** Enables horizontal scaling of service instances by adding more pods/containers as demand increases.
*   **Data Layer Scaling:** Use of distributed data stores (Data Lake, Data Warehouse) and read replicas for databases to handle increasing data volumes and query loads.
*   **LLM Optimization:** Techniques like prompt batching, caching LLM responses (Redis), and leveraging smaller, fine-tuned models for specific tasks to optimize inference costs and throughput.

**2. Security Considerations:**
*   **Authentication & Authorization:** OAuth2/JWT for user authentication, RBAC for granular access control to reports and features. The API Gateway enforces these policies.
*   **Data Encryption:** All data will be encrypted at rest (e.g., S3 bucket encryption, database encryption) and in transit (TLS/SSL for all inter-service and client-service communication).
*   **Secrets Management:** Sensitive credentials (API keys, database passwords) are stored and managed using dedicated secrets management services (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Vault).
*   **Least Privilege Principle:** Service accounts and user roles are granted only the minimum necessary permissions to perform their functions.
*   **Input Validation & Output Sanitization:** To prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
*   **Network Segmentation:** Microservices are deployed in isolated network segments with strict firewall rules to limit lateral movement.
*   **Regular Security Audits & Vulnerability Scanning:** Automated and manual checks for security vulnerabilities in code and infrastructure.
*   **Data Governance:** Adherence to data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA) by design, including data anonymization/pseudonymization where necessary.

**3. Performance Optimizations:**
*   **Asynchronous I/O:** Python's `asyncio` and frameworks like FastAPI are used to handle concurrent requests efficiently, especially for I/O-bound operations like external API calls.
*   **Caching:** Redis is used for caching frequently accessed data, LLM responses, and report segments to reduce latency and database load.
*   **Efficient Data Storage & Retrieval:** Optimized database schema design, indexing, and use of appropriate data stores (e.g., Vector DB for semantic search, Data Warehouse for analytical queries).
*   **LLM Prompt Engineering:** Crafting concise and effective prompts to minimize token usage and LLM processing time.
*   **Batch Processing:** For large data analysis tasks and LLM inference, batching requests can significantly improve throughput and reduce costs.
*   **Content Delivery Network (CDN):** If reports are served as static files or web pages, a CDN can deliver them quickly to geographically dispersed users.
*   **Real-time vs. Batch:** Design for real-time data streaming for continuous monitoring where needed, while leveraging batch processing for less time-sensitive, large-scale analyses.

**4. Maintainability Features:**
*   **Modularity (Microservices):** Each service is a small, cohesive codebase, easier to understand, develop, test, and debug independently.
*   **Clean Architecture:** Enforces separation of concerns within services, making it easier to swap out external dependencies (e.g., different LLM providers, database types) without affecting business logic.
*   **Comprehensive Documentation:**
    *   **API Documentation:** OpenAPI/Swagger specifications for all service APIs.
    *   **Code Documentation:** Adherence to PEP 257 for docstrings, clear inline comments.
    *   **Project Documentation:** READMEs for each service/module, architectural diagrams, deployment guides.
*   **Standardized Coding Practices:** Strict adherence to PEP 8, consistent naming conventions, and code style across the entire codebase.
*   **Automated Testing:** Comprehensive suite of unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
*   **Centralized Logging & Monitoring:** Provides a holistic view of system health, making it easier to diagnose issues and trace requests across services.
*   **Containerization (Docker):** Ensures consistent deployment environments across development, testing, and production, eliminating "it works on my machine" issues.
*   **Version Control (Git):** Facilitates collaborative development, change tracking, and rollbacks.
