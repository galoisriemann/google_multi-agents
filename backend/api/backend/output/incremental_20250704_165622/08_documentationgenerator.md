The framework is built with a microservices-inspired architecture, promoting modularity, scalability, and maintainability.

## Installation
To set up and run this framework, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository (Conceptual):**
    In a real scenario, you would clone the project repository. For this response, assume the code snippets are organized as described in the "Project Structure" section (`src/`, `tests/`, `requirements.txt`).

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment:**
    It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Create a `requirements.txt` file in the project root with the following content:
    ```
    pydantic>=2.0.0
    pytest>=7.0.0
    aiohttp>=3.0.0
    tenacity>=8.0.0
    ```
    Then install them:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: For actual LLM integration, you would add `google-generativeai` or `openai` to `requirements.txt`.)*

4.  **Configure Environment Variables (for LLM API Key):**
    Set your LLM API key as an environment variable. Replace `YOUR_ACTUAL_LLM_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual key.
    On Linux/macOS:
    ```bash
    export LLM_API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_LLM_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```
    On Windows (Command Prompt):
    ```bash
    set LLM_API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_LLM_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```
    On Windows (PowerShell):
    ```bash
    $env:LLM_API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_LLM_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```
    **Important:** The system will raise an error if `LLM_API_KEY` is not set. You can also configure the `REPORT_OUTPUT_DIR` environment variable if you want reports saved to a custom location.

## Quick Start
To generate a sample market research report:

1.  Ensure you have completed the [Installation](#installation) steps.
2.  Navigate to the project root directory.
3.  Run the main application script:
    ```bash
    python src/main.py
    ```
    This will execute a demonstration workflow, generating two sample reports (one standard, one personalized) and conceptually showing the market monitoring service. The generated `.txt` reports will be saved in the `generated_reports` directory.

    You will see output similar to:
    ```
    --- Generating Standard Report ---
    ... (logging messages) ...
    Standard Report generated! Status: COMPLETED
    Report ID: <generated-id>
    File Path: <path-to-report.txt>
    --- Executive Summary ---
    **Executive Summary (Gemini)**
    This report provides a comprehensive overview of the Artificial Intelligence industry...
    ```

## Examples

Below is a simplified example demonstrating how to interact with the `ReportGenerationOrchestrator`. For a full runnable example, refer to the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block in `src/main.py`.

```python
import asyncio
from src.main import ReportGenerationOrchestrator
from src.modules.models import ResearchRequest

async def run_example_report_generation():
    orchestrator = ReportGenerationOrchestrator()

    # Define a sample research request
    sample_request = ResearchRequest(
        industry="Artificial Intelligence",
        target_market_segments=["Generative AI", "AI in Healthcare"],
        key_competitors=["OpenAI", "Google DeepMind", "Microsoft Azure AI"],
        focus_areas=[
            "industry_analysis",
            "market_trends",
            "technology_adoption",
            "strategic_recommendations",
            "executive_summary"
        ]
    )

    print("--- Generating Standard Report ---")
    try:
        generated_report = await orchestrator.generate_market_research_report(sample_request)
        print(f"\nReport generated! Status: {generated_report.status}")
        print(f"Report ID: {generated_report.report_id}")
        print(f"File Path: {generated_report.file_path}")
        print("\n--- Executive Summary ---")
        print(generated_report.executive_summary.content)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to generate report: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(run_example_report_generation())
```
```

### User Guide
```markdown
# User Guide

This guide provides instructions for using the LLM-Guided Gartner-Style Market Research Report Generation Framework.

## Getting Started

### 1. Framework Setup
Before generating reports, ensure the framework is set up as described in the [README.md Installation](#installation) section. This includes:
*   Cloning the repository (conceptually).
*   Setting up a Python virtual environment.
*   Installing all required dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
*   Crucially, setting your `LLM_API_KEY` as an environment variable. Without this, the framework will not run.

### 2. Defining a Research Request
The core of interacting with the framework is defining a `ResearchRequest`. This Python object (from `src/modules/models.py`) specifies what kind of report you want to generate.

**Key parameters for a `ResearchRequest`:**
*   `industry` (string, **required**): The primary industry for your research (e.g., "Fintech", "Electric Vehicles", "Cloud Computing").
*   `target_market_segments` (list of strings, optional): Specific segments within the industry (e.g., ["Generative AI", "AI in Healthcare"] for "Artificial Intelligence").
*   `key_competitors` (list of strings, optional): Names of specific companies to analyze within the competitive landscape.
*   `start_date`, `end_date` (strings, optional, YYYY-MM-DD): Date range for data analysis (currently conceptual in data ingestion).
*   `focus_areas` (list of strings, optional): Which sections of the report to generate. Defaults to all major sections:
    *   `"industry_analysis"`
    *   `"market_trends"`
    *   `"technology_adoption"`
    *   `"strategic_recommendations"`
    *   `"executive_summary"`
*   `personalized_customer_id` (string, optional): Provide a customer ID if you want the strategic recommendations to be tailored based on conceptual customer insights.

**Example Request:**
```python
from src.modules.models import ResearchRequest

my_request = ResearchRequest(
    industry="Quantum Computing",
    target_market_segments=["Hardware", "Software & Algorithms"],
    key_competitors=["IBM Quantum", "Google Quantum AI", "IonQ"],
    focus_areas=["industry_analysis", "technology_adoption", "strategic_recommendations"],
    start_date="2022-01-01",
    end_date="2024-12-31"
)
```

### 3. Generating a Report
Once your `ResearchRequest` is defined, you pass it to the `ReportGenerationOrchestrator`.

```python
import asyncio
from src.main import ReportGenerationOrchestrator
from src.modules.models import ResearchRequest

async def generate_my_report():
    orchestrator = ReportGenerationOrchestrator()
    
    my_request = ResearchRequest(
        industry="Space Exploration",
        target_market_segments=["Commercial Spaceflight", "Satellite Services"],
        key_competitors=["SpaceX", "Blue Origin", "Arianespace"]
    )

    print(f"Initiating report for {my_request.industry}...")
    try:
        report = await orchestrator.generate_market_research_report(my_request)
        print(f"\nReport generated successfully! Status: {report.status}")
        print(f"Report Title: {report.title}")
        print(f"Report saved to: {report.file_path}")
        print("\n--- Executive Summary of your report ---")
        print(report.executive_summary.content)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to generate report: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(generate_my_report())
```
The generated report will be saved as a `.txt` file in the `generated_reports` directory at the project root. The console output will also show the executive summary and file path.

## Advanced Usage

### Personalized Reports
To generate a report with recommendations tailored to a specific customer's needs:
1.  Ensure that `customer_feedback_data` (or similar internal customer data) is conceptually available in your `DataIngestionService`'s simulated data. In a real system, this would integrate with your CRM/sales databases.
2.  Set the `personalized_customer_id` field in your `ResearchRequest`.
    ```python
    personalized_req = ResearchRequest(
        industry="E-commerce",
        # ... other fields ...
        personalized_customer_id="customer_123" # Use an ID known to your system
    )
    # Then pass this request to the orchestrator as shown above
    ```
    The `Strategic Insights and Actionable Recommendations` section, and potentially the `Executive Summary`, will include points derived from the conceptual customer insights.

### Continuous Monitoring (Conceptual)
The framework includes a `MarketMonitoringService` to demonstrate the concept of continuous market intelligence.
*   **Adding Requests to Monitor:** You can add `ResearchRequest` objects to this service to be conceptually monitored.
    ```python
    from src.main import MarketMonitoringService
    # ... assuming orchestrator and sample_request are defined ...
    monitor_service = MarketMonitoringService(orchestrator)
    monitor_service.add_request_to_monitor(sample_request)
    ```
*   **Checking for Updates:** In a real production system, this service would run continuously, reactively consuming data streams. For demonstration, the `check_for_updates()` method can be called periodically. If a "significant change" is conceptually detected (simulated by a time-based trigger in the demo), it will trigger a new report generation for the monitored request.
    ```python
    # ... in an async function context ...
    for _ in range(5): # Run checks a few times
        await monitor_service.check_for_updates()
        await asyncio.sleep(60) # Simulate waiting for 1 minute
    ```
    **Note:** This feature is currently conceptual for demonstration purposes. In production, it would involve robust event-driven architectures and persistent state management.

## Best Practices

*   **Data Quality:** The quality of the generated report is directly dependent on the quality of the input data. Ensure your data ingestion sources provide accurate, up-to-date, and relevant information. Implement data cleansing and validation processes (`DataProcessingService`) rigorously.
*   **LLM Prompt Effectiveness:** While the framework handles prompt engineering internally, understanding the LLM's capabilities (e.g., using simpler models for basic tasks) can enhance performance and cost-efficiency.
*   **Security & Privacy:** Always handle sensitive information (like LLM API keys and customer PII) securely, using environment variables and ensuring data encryption. Refer to the [Quality and Security Notes](#quality-and-security-notes) for more details.
*   **Resource Management:** For large-scale report generation or very complex analyses, be mindful of computational resources (CPU, RAM, LLM token usage). The asynchronous design helps, but distributed computing solutions would be necessary for extreme loads.

## Troubleshooting

*   **`ValueError: LLM_API_KEY environment variable not set.`**
    *   **Reason:** The framework explicitly requires the `LLM_API_KEY` to be set as an environment variable for security.
    *   **Solution:** Follow step 4 in the [Installation](#installation) section to set the `LLM_API_KEY` before running the application.

*   **"Failed to generate report: ..." errors in console.**
    *   **Reason:** This is a general error catch. Possible reasons include network issues connecting to LLM providers, problems with data processing, or internal logic errors.
    *   **Solution:** Check the detailed log messages in the console. The framework logs `INFO` and `ERROR` messages that should provide more context on which service failed and why. For LLM-related issues, verify your internet connection and LLM API key.

*   **Report content seems generic or incomplete.**
    *   **Reason:** The conceptual LLM responses are designed to be generic for demonstration. In a real scenario, this could indicate insufficient or irrelevant data provided to the LLM, or the LLM's context window might have been exceeded.
    *   **Solution:** Ensure the simulated `raw_data` in `DataIngestionService` and `MarketData` in `DataProcessingService` are rich enough to generate the desired insights. For a real LLM, consider implementing more sophisticated RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) strategies to provide targeted context.

*   **Performance is slow for many reports.**
    *   **Reason:** While the framework is designed asynchronously, real LLM calls introduce significant latency. The current demo also has simulated `asyncio.sleep` calls.
    *   **Solution:** In a production environment, implement proper caching (e.g., Redis) for frequently requested insights. Optimize LLM prompts to reduce token usage and consider dynamic model selection (using smaller, faster models for simpler tasks). For truly high throughput, consider a distributed microservices deployment with Kubernetes.

## Contributing Guidelines

We welcome contributions to this framework! Please follow these guidelines:

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Start by forking the project repository.
2.  **Branching Strategy:** Use a feature-branch workflow. Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix (e.g., `feature/add-new-datasource`, `bugfix/fix-llm-error`).
3.  **Code Style:** Adhere to [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) for code style. Use `black` and `isort` for automated formatting.
4.  **Docstrings and Type Hinting:** All new modules, classes, and public methods must have comprehensive [PEP 257](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/) docstrings and clear [Type Hinting](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html).
5.  **Testing:**
    *   Write unit tests for all new or modified logic in the `tests/` directory.
    *   Ensure tests cover both happy paths and edge cases.
    *   Use `pytest` and `unittest.mock` for effective test isolation.
    *   Maintain high test coverage.
6.  **Commit Messages:** Write clear, concise, and descriptive commit messages.
7.  **Pull Requests:** Submit pull requests to the `main` branch. Provide a detailed description of your changes, why they were made, and any relevant test results.
8.  **Dependencies:** Manage dependencies using `pipenv` or a `venv` and update `requirements.txt` accordingly.

## Testing Instructions

The framework includes a comprehensive suite of unit tests using `pytest`.

1.  **Ensure Dependencies are Installed:**
    Make sure you have `pytest` installed (included in `requirements.txt`).
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Run All Tests:**
    From the project root directory, execute `pytest`:
    ```bash
    pytest tests/
    ```
    This command will discover and run all tests defined in the `tests/` directory.

3.  **Run Specific Test File:**
    To run tests from a specific file (e.g., `test_main.py`):
    ```bash
    pytest tests/test_main.py
    ```

4.  **Run Specific Test Function:**
    To run a single test function (e.g., `test_generate_report_document` within `TestDataProcessingService`):
    ```bash
    pytest tests/test_main.py::TestDataProcessingService::test_generate_report_document
    ```

5.  **Understanding Test Output:**
    *   A dot (`.`) indicates a passing test.
    *   `F` indicates a failing test.
    *   `E` indicates an error during test execution.
    *   `S` indicates a skipped test.
    *   At the end, `pytest` will provide a summary of the test results.

The tests extensively use `unittest.mock.patch` and `AsyncMock` to simulate external dependencies (like LLM API calls and data sources), ensuring tests are fast and reliable without requiring actual external service connectivity.

## Deployment Guide

This framework is designed for cloud-native deployment using a microservices approach.

1.  **Containerization (Docker):**
    Each logical service within `src/modules` (e.g., `DataIngestionService`, `AnalysisAndSynthesisService`) should be packaged into its own Docker container. This ensures consistent environments across development, testing, and production.

2.  **Orchestration (Kubernetes):**
    Deploy the Docker containers using a container orchestration platform like Kubernetes (EKS on AWS, GKE on GCP, AKS on Azure). Kubernetes provides:
    *   **Automatic Scaling:** Configure Horizontal Pod Autoscalers (HPAs) based on CPU, memory, or custom metrics (e.g., number of pending requests) to scale service instances up or down based on demand.
    *   **Service Discovery:** Services can find each other easily.
    *   **Load Balancing:** Distributes traffic evenly across service instances.
    *   **Self-Healing:** Automatically restarts failed containers.

3.  **Messaging System (Apache Kafka):**
    Implement Apache Kafka as the central message broker for asynchronous communication between services. This decouples services, enhances resilience, and enables event-driven workflows (e.g., `Data Ingestion` service publishes `raw_data_ingested` events, `Data Processing` service consumes them).

4.  **Managed Cloud Services:**
    Leverage managed cloud database services (e.g., PostgreSQL for operational data, Snowflake/BigQuery for analytical data) and object storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) for persistent data storage. Use a managed Vector Database (Pinecone, Weaviate) for RAG capabilities.

5.  **CI/CD Pipelines:**
    Set up robust Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines (e.g., using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins). These pipelines should automate:
    *   Code Linting and Formatting.
    *   Unit and Integration Testing.
    *   Docker Image Building and Pushing to a Container Registry.
    *   Deployment to Kubernetes clusters (e.g., via Helm charts or Kubernetes manifests managed by GitOps).

6.  **Secrets Management:**
    Do not hardcode sensitive information (API keys, database credentials). Use cloud-native secrets management services (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Google Secret Manager, Azure Key Vault) and inject them securely into your containers as environment variables or mounted files.

7.  **Observability:**
    Implement comprehensive monitoring, logging, and tracing:
    *   **Logging:** Centralized logging (e.g., ELK Stack, CloudWatch Logs) for collecting and analyzing application logs. Ensure structured logging and PII redaction.
    *   **Monitoring:** Collect metrics (CPU, memory, network I/O, custom application metrics like report generation latency, LLM token usage) using Prometheus/Grafana or cloud-native monitoring tools.
    *   **Tracing:** Use distributed tracing (e.g., Jaeger, OpenTelemetry) to visualize request flows across microservices and pinpoint performance bottlenecks.

### Quality and Security Notes
```markdown
# Quality and Security Report

This report summarizes the code quality, security posture, performance characteristics, and known limitations of the LLM-Guided Gartner-Style Market Research Report Generation Framework.

## Code Quality Summary

**Strengths:**
*   **Exceptional Modularity and Structure:** Logical organization into `src/`, `tests/`, and `modules/` with clear conceptual service encapsulation, effectively mirroring the microservices architecture.
*   **Strong Adherence to Python Best Practices:** Excellent PEP 8 compliance, comprehensive PEP 257 docstrings, and consistent use of type hinting significantly enhance readability and maintainability.
*   **Effective Use of Pydantic:** Robust data validation, serialization/deserialization, and clear schema definitions via Pydantic models (e.g., `ResearchRequest`, `MarketData`).
*   **Comprehensive Unit Testing:** Well-designed `pytest` suite with effective mocking (`unittest.mock.patch`, `AsyncMock`, custom `MockLLMIntegrationService`) ensures fast, reliable, and isolated tests. Good coverage for orchestrator flow and individual service functionalities.
*   **Clear Orchestration Logic:** `ReportGenerationOrchestrator` in `main.py` clearly defines and manages the end-to-end workflow.
*   **Consistent Logging:** Centralized `setup_logging` utility for informative logging, crucial for debugging and monitoring.
*   **Explicit Conceptualization:** Meticulous comments differentiate simulated versus real-world implementations, setting clear expectations.
*   **Robust Simulated LLM Responses:** `LLMIntegrationService`'s simulated LLM outputs are well-crafted to demonstrate expected behavior without live API calls.
*   **Extensible LLM Integration:** Introduced `AbstractLLMClient` and concrete client implementations for easy addition of new LLM providers.

**Areas for Improvement (for production-grade quality):**
*   **Granular Error Handling:** While some specific exceptions are caught, more fine-grained error handling within individual services would allow for more precise recovery strategies.
*   **Persistence for Market Monitoring:** The `MarketMonitoringService` currently uses in-memory storage for monitored requests; persistence is required for production.
*   **Security for LLM API Key Default:** The `Config` class now raises an error if `LLM_API_KEY` is not set, which is an improvement, but ensuring no sensitive defaults exist in source code is paramount.
*   **`_validate_llm_output` Realism:** This crucial hallucination mitigation step is conceptual and needs robust implementation (e.g., RAG, factual consistency checks, human-in-the-loop).
*   **Augment Report Formatting:** For true "Gartner-style" reports, integration with rich document generation libraries (`python-docx`, `ReportLab`) and templating engines (Jinja2) with dynamic charts/tables is needed.
*   **Dedicated Request Management Service:** A full microservice for request lifecycle and persistence would enhance the system.

## Security Assessment

**Critical Issues (Addressed Conceptually/Partially in Refactor, Requires Full Production Implementation):**
*   **LLM Prompt Injection Vulnerability:** Addressed conceptually by input sanitization in `ResearchRequest` and `DataProcessingService` (comments for content-level sanitization) and enhanced `_validate_llm_output`. **Full mitigation requires robust data cleansing and active LLM instruction tuning/monitoring.**
*   **Insecure Handling of Sensitive PII/Customer Data (Personalization):** Addressed conceptually by logging redaction and comments emphasizing encryption at rest/in transit, and strict access controls. **Full mitigation requires explicit implementation of these measures adhering to GDPR/CCPA.**
*   **Path Traversal Vulnerability in Report Generation:** Mitigated by robust `pathlib` usage and filename sanitization in `ReportGenerationService`. **Best practice is to store reports in secure object storage (e.g., S3) with fine-grained access policies in production.**

**Medium Priority Issues (Addressed Conceptually/Partially in Refactor):**
*   **Overly Broad Exception Handling:** Improved by specific `ValueError` catch in `main.py`; further granularity is beneficial.
*   **Information Disclosure via Logging:** Addressed by `redact_sensitive_data` utility and comments on structured logging/redaction.
*   **Authentication and Authorization:** Remains conceptual; **full implementation of API Gateway AuthN/AuthZ and service-to-service authentication is critical for production.**
*   **Lack of Explicit Output Sanitization for Report Content:** Relevant if reports are rendered in rich text/HTML; less critical for `.txt` but good practice for untrusted content.

**Security Best Practices Followed (Foundational):**
*   **Modular Architecture:** Limits blast radius of vulnerabilities.
*   **Pydantic for Data Validation:** Enforces schema validation for data integrity.
*   **Environment Variables for Secrets:** `LLM_API_KEY` is sourced from env var, preventing hardcoding.
*   **Conceptual LLM Hallucination Mitigation:** Acknowledged and conceptually present.
*   **Logging Mechanism:** Consistent logging, essential for auditing.
*   **Explicit Dependency Management:** `requirements.txt` ensures controlled dependencies.

**Compliance Notes (General Considerations for Production):**
*   **OWASP Top 10:** Key concerns like Injection (especially Prompt Injection), Broken Access Control, Insecure Design, and Sensitive Data Exposure are primary targets for comprehensive security hardening.
*   **GDPR / CCPA:** Handling PII requires strict adherence to data minimization, purpose limitation, consent, and strong security measures (encryption, access control).
*   **Cloud Security Best Practices:** Implement secure infrastructure, network segmentation, and IAM roles if deployed to cloud.

## Performance Characteristics

**Critical Performance Issues (Primarily for Production Implementation):**
*   **LLM Call Latency and Sequential Execution:** In the original design, multiple sequential LLM calls caused high latency. **Refactored: Addressed by parallelizing independent LLM calls using `asyncio.gather` in `AnalysisAndSynthesisService`.**
*   **Lack of Asynchronous I/O:** Synchronous I/O blocks execution. **Refactored: Implemented `asyncio` for all I/O-bound service methods (`DataIngestionService`, `LLMIntegrationService`, `ReportGenerationService`).**
*   **Data Processing Scalability:** In-memory processing limits large datasets. **Refactored: Comments indicate the need for distributed processing frameworks (Spark, Dask) for true scalability.**

**Optimization Opportunities (Implemented Conceptually or as Recommendations):**
*   **Parallelize LLM Calls:** Implemented in `AnalysisAndSynthesisService`.
*   **Introduce Asynchronous Operations:** Implemented across services.
*   **LLM Token & Cost Optimization:**
    *   **Prompt Engineering:** Still a crucial aspect for external implementation.
    *   **Model Selection:** Implemented conceptual dynamic model selection (e.g., `model="fast"` for summaries).
    *   **Context Window Management:** Conceptualized through RAG notes in `AnalysisAndSynthesisService`.
*   **Caching LLM Responses and Processed Data:** Implemented conceptual in-memory `_llm_cache`; recommends Redis for production.
*   **Efficient Data Handling:** Recommends distributed processing for large datasets.
*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implemented conceptual `tenacity` retry decorators for LLM calls.

**Algorithmic Analysis (Reflected in asynchronous design):**
*   **Overall Orchestration:** Time complexity improved by parallel LLM calls; now dominated by the longest-running parallel LLM call plus sequential steps.
*   **Data Ingestion:** `O(1)` mocked, but would be I/O bound in real-world, now `async`.
*   **Data Processing:** `O(N)` for current mock; distributed frameworks needed for large N.
*   **LLM Integration:** Significant latency per call, now `async` with retries.
*   **Analysis & Synthesis:** `O(L_llm_call_max)` due to parallelization.
*   **Report Generation:** `O(D)` (document size), now `async` for file I/O.

**Resource Utilization:**
*   **Memory Usage:** Still a concern for *truly massive* datasets (recommend distributed processing).
*   **CPU Utilization:** Improved by `asyncio` for I/O-bound tasks.
*   **I/O Efficiency:** Network I/O (LLMs) and Disk I/O (reports) are crucial bottlenecks addressed by `async` operations and Executor for file writes.

**Scalability Assessment:**
*   **Current Code (Refactored):** Much better suited for vertical scaling due to `asyncio` but still a single Python process for CPU-bound tasks (due to GIL).
*   **Architectural Design:** Excellent potential for horizontal scaling via microservices, Kafka, Kubernetes, and managed cloud services.

## Known Limitations

*   **Simulated Data Sources:** All data ingestion is currently simulated (`DataIngestionService`). Real-world integration requires robust connectors to various external and internal data APIs.
*   **Conceptual LLM Integration:** While the `LLMIntegrationService` provides an abstract interface, actual integration with LLM providers (e.g., Google Gemini, OpenAI GPT) requires their client libraries and API keys. The `_validate_llm_output` for hallucination mitigation is a conceptual placeholder.
*   **Limited Report Formatting:** The `ReportGenerationService` currently outputs simple `.txt` files. Generating rich, visually appealing Gartner-style reports (e.g., PDF, DOCX with dynamic charts/tables) requires integration with dedicated document generation libraries and templating engines.
*   **In-Memory Caching:** The `_llm_cache` is a simple in-memory dictionary. A production system requires a distributed cache (e.g., Redis) for effectiveness across multiple service instances.
*   **Conceptual Persistence:** The `MarketMonitoringService`'s state (`monitored_requests`) is in-memory. In a real system, this state would need to be persisted in a database.
*   **No Actual API Gateway/Authentication/Authorization:** The framework does not include a functional API Gateway or user authentication/authorization logic. These are critical for securing a production system.
*   **Simplified Data Processing:** `DataProcessingService` performs basic in-memory transformations. For large-scale data, a distributed processing framework (like Spark) would be essential.
*   **Human-in-the-Loop:** While critical for high-stakes market research reports, the framework does not include explicit workflows for human review or validation of LLM outputs.

### Changelog
```markdown
# Changelog

## Version History

### 1.0.0 - Initial Refactored Release (YYYY-MM-DD)
*   **Description:** First comprehensive release of the LLM-Guided Gartner-Style Market Research Report Generation Framework, incorporating a modular microservices-inspired architecture with significant enhancements for performance, security, and quality. This version establishes the core functionality for report generation, analysis, and conceptual continuous monitoring.

## Breaking Changes

This release introduces several breaking changes due to the adoption of asynchronous programming and enhanced security configurations.

1.  **Asynchronous Functions (`async/await`)**
    *   **Impact:** All core service methods that involve I/O operations (e.g., `DataIngestionService.ingest_data`, `LLMIntegrationService.generate_text`, `AnalysisAndSynthesisService`'s analysis methods, `ReportGenerationService.generate_report_document`) are now `async def` functions. Any direct synchronous calls to these methods will fail.
    *   **Affected Files:** `src/modules/data_ingestion.py`, `src/modules/llm_integration.py`, `src/modules/analysis_synthesis.py`, `src/modules/report_generation.py`, `src/main.py`.

2.  **LLM API Key Environment Variable Enforcement**
    *   **Impact:** The `Config` class now explicitly validates the presence of the `LLM_API_KEY` environment variable. If it's not set, a `ValueError` will be raised immediately upon initialization. This prevents accidental use of placeholder keys in production.
    *   **Affected Files:** `src/modules/config.py`.

3.  **`ResearchRequest` Input Sanitization**
    *   **Impact:** The `ResearchRequest` Pydantic model now includes basic input sanitization using validators. This may alter input strings if they contain characters or patterns deemed unsafe (e.g., path separators, HTML tags).
    *   **Affected Files:** `src/modules/models.py`.

## Migration Guides

To migrate your existing usage or integrate with this refactored version:

1.  **Update Dependencies:**
    Modify your `requirements.txt` file to include `aiohttp` (or `httpx`) and `tenacity`.
    ```
    pydantic>=2.0.0
    pytest>=7.0.0
    aiohttp>=3.0.0 # Or httpx>=0.20.0
    tenacity>=8.0.0
    ```
    Then, run:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Adjust Code for `async/await`:**
    *   **For `ReportGenerationOrchestrator` calls:** Any code that directly invokes `orchestrator.generate_market_research_report()` must be changed to `await orchestrator.generate_market_research_report()`. This call must, in turn, be made from within an `async def` function.
    *   **Running the Main Application:** If you are running `src/main.py` directly, ensure you wrap the execution in `asyncio.run()` as shown in the updated `main.py`'s `if __name__ == "__main__":` block.
    *   **Internal Service Calls:** If you were directly calling methods of individual services (e.g., `DataIngestionService`, `LLMIntegrationService`), those calls must also be prefixed with `await` and executed within an `async` context.

3.  **Set Environment Variables:**
    Before running the application, ensure the `LLM_API_KEY` environment variable is set. For example:
    *   Linux/macOS: `export LLM_API_KEY="your_actual_llm_api_key"`
    *   Windows (CMD): `set LLM_API_KEY="your_actual_llm_api_key"`
    *   Windows (PowerShell): `$env:LLM_API_KEY="your_actual_llm_api_key"`
    Optionally, you can also set `REPORT_OUTPUT_DIR` and `CACHE_ENABLED` via environment variables.

4.  **Review `ResearchRequest` Inputs:**
    If you have automated systems generating `ResearchRequest` objects, verify that the content of `industry`, `target_market_segments`, `key_competitors`, and `focus_areas` fields do not rely on characters that will be sanitized by the new Pydantic validators. Adjust inputs as necessary.

5.  **Re-run Unit Tests:**
    After applying the migration steps, run the updated unit tests to confirm that all functionalities work as expected in the new asynchronous environment:
    ```bash
    pytest tests/
    ```

**Non-Breaking Enhancements:**
*   **Improved `ReportGenerationService` File Paths:** Uses `pathlib` for more robust and secure file path handling.
*   **Conceptual Caching:** An in-memory cache for LLM responses is introduced, configurable via `CACHE_ENABLED` in `Config.py` (defaults to `False`).
*   **Logging Redaction:** Sensitive data is conceptually redacted from logs for improved security.
*   **Retry Mechanisms:** LLM API calls now include conceptual retry logic using `tenacity` for increased resilience against transient failures.
*   **Extensible LLM Client Architecture:** The `LLMIntegrationService` now uses an abstract interface for LLM clients, making it easier to integrate new LLM providers in the future.
