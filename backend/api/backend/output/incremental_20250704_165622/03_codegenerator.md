## Code Implementation

The following code provides a comprehensive framework for an LLM-guided Gartner-style market research report generation. It adheres to a modular design, simulating the interactions between microservices as outlined in the architectural design. The LLM interactions are conceptualized with placeholder responses, and data sources are simulated for demonstration purposes.

### Installation and Usage Instructions

To set up and run this framework:

1.  **Clone the Repository (Conceptual):**
    In a real scenario, you would clone the project repository. For this response, assume the code snippets are organized as described in the "Project Structure" section.

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment:**
    It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Create a `requirements.txt` file in the project root with the following content:
    ```
    pydantic>=2.0.0
    pytest>=7.0.0
    ```
    Then install them:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: For actual LLM integration, you would add `google-generativeai` or `openai` to `requirements.txt`.)*

4.  **Configure Environment Variables (for LLM API Key):**
    Set your LLM API key as an environment variable. Replace `YOUR_ACTUAL_LLM_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual key.
    On Linux/macOS:
    ```bash
    export LLM_API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_LLM_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```
    On Windows (Command Prompt):
    ```bash
    set LLM_API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_LLM_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```
    On Windows (PowerShell):
    ```bash
    $env:LLM_API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_LLM_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```
    Alternatively, you can modify `src/modules/config.py` directly, but using environment variables is preferred for sensitive information.

5.  **Run the Main Application:**
    Navigate to the project root and run the `main.py` script. This will demonstrate the report generation flow for sample requests.
    ```bash
    python src/main.py
    ```
    The generated reports (text files) will be saved in the `generated_reports` directory at the project root.

6.  **Run Unit Tests:**
    From the project root directory, run `pytest`:
    ```bash
    pytest tests/
    ```
    This will execute all defined unit tests, ensuring the core logic of the framework components works as expected.

7.  **Conceptual Deployment Notes:**
    *   **Containerization:** For production deployment, each conceptual service (`DataIngestionService`, `AnalysisAndSynthesisService`, etc.) would ideally be packaged into its own Docker container.
    *   **Orchestration:** Kubernetes (EKS, GKE, AKS) would be used to deploy, manage, and scale these containers.
    *   **Messaging:** A message broker like Apache Kafka would facilitate asynchronous communication between services (e.g., `DataIngestion` publishes "raw_data_ingested" events, `DataProcessing` subscribes to them).
    *   **Databases:** Integrate with external, managed database services (PostgreSQL, Snowflake, Pinecone) for persistent data storage.
    *   **CI/CD:** Implement CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD) to automate testing, building, and deployment of services.
