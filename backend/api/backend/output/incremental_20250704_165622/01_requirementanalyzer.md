## Requirements Analysis

### Functional Requirements
- **Industry and Competitive Analysis:** The framework shall identify key players, market share, competitive advantages, and strategic positioning within a specified industry. It should map the competitive landscape, including Porter's Five Forces analysis where applicable.
- **Market Trends Identification and Future Prediction:** The framework shall analyze historical and real-time data to identify emerging market trends, growth drivers, and potential disruptions. It must generate future predictions, including market size, growth rates, and technological shifts.
- **Technology Adoption Analysis and Recommendations:** The framework shall assess the current state of technology adoption within the target market, evaluate the impact of new technologies, and provide recommendations for strategic technology integration and investment.
- **Strategic Insights and Actionable Recommendations:** Based on the analyzed data, the framework shall generate strategic insights, highlighting key opportunities and challenges. It must provide clear, actionable recommendations tailored to specific business needs (e.g., market entry strategies, product development, competitive response).
- **Executive Summary Generation:** The framework shall synthesize all key findings, insights, and recommendations into a concise and comprehensive executive summary, adhering to a professional report structure (e.g., Gartner style).
- **Custom Report Generation:** Users shall be able to specify research requirements (e.g., by industry, competitor, market segment) to generate focused reports with relevant metrics and competitive analyses.
- **Data Aggregation and Processing:** The framework shall integrate with various data sources, including industry news, company reports, SEC filings, market databases, research papers, primary research sources (e.g., Nielsen, Kantar), and real-time social media signals, for comprehensive data collection.
- **LLM-Powered Analysis and Synthesis:** Large Language Models (LLMs) shall process collected data to extract insights, identify market patterns, and analyze correlations between data points.
- **Personalization Engine:** The framework shall derive customer-specific action items based on customer interactions, sales trends, and marketing outreach, integrating these into the report.
- **Continuous Monitoring and Updates:** The framework shall continuously monitor market developments and automatically incorporate new data to keep reports current with real-time industry changes.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance Requirements:**
    - Report generation for standard queries should complete within a specified timeframe (e.g., minutes to hours, depending on complexity and data volume), aligning with the need for "real-time" insights as opposed to "slow delivery" as mentioned in `test_ppt.pptx`.
    - Data aggregation and processing pipelines must be optimized for speed to handle large datasets efficiently.
- **Security Requirements:**
    - All data processing and storage must comply with relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
    - Access to sensitive market data and generated reports must be secured through authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    - Input and output data, especially when processed by LLMs, should be handled securely to prevent data leakage.
- **Scalability Requirements:**
    - The framework must be modular and designed to scale horizontally to accommodate increasing data volumes, more concurrent research requests, and integration with additional data sources.
    - The underlying infrastructure should support dynamic resource allocation for LLM processing and data storage.
- **Usability Requirements:**
    - The generated reports should be clear, concise, and easy to understand for business executives, following a "Gartner style" presentation.
    - The interface for defining research requirements should be intuitive and user-friendly.
    - Documentation for framework implementation must be comprehensive and easy to follow.

### Technical Constraints
- **Technology Stack Preferences:**
    - The core of the framework must utilize Large Language Models for analysis and synthesis.
    - Python is the preferred language for implementation, adhering to Python best practices as outlined in `coding_standards.docx` (PEP 8, PEP 20, PEP 257).
    - Data processing components should leverage modern data engineering practices.
- **Platform Constraints:**
    - The framework should ideally be cloud-agnostic or support deployment on major cloud providers (e.g., GCP, AWS, Azure) to ensure scalability and flexibility.
- **Integration Requirements:**
    - The framework must support integration with various internal and external data sources as identified in `test_ppt.pptx`.
    - APIs or other programmatic interfaces should be provided for integrating with existing business intelligence tools or platforms.
- **Documentation Standards:**
    - Detailed implementation documentation is required, adhering to best practices such as PEP 257 for docstrings, comprehensive README files, and potentially using tools like Sphinx and Read The Docs for auto-generated documentation, as highlighted in `coding_standards.docx`.
    - Version control (Git) must be used for source code management, and virtual environments should be utilized to manage project dependencies (`coding_standards.docx`).

### Assumptions and Clarifications
- **Assumptions Made:**
    - It is assumed that access to relevant LLM APIs (e.g., proprietary or open-source models) will be available and budgeted for.
    - It is assumed that necessary data connectors and APIs for integrating with external market data sources will be available or can be developed.
    - It is assumed that the "Gartner style" refers to a professional, data-driven, and insight-rich report format, rather than a specific proprietary template.
    - It is assumed that the output reports will primarily be textual, possibly with embedded charts/tables, and that a specific interactive dashboard format is not an initial requirement.
- **Questions that Need Clarification:**
    - What are the specific criteria for "Gartner style"? Are there any example reports or templates that can be used as a reference for formatting, depth of analysis, and visual presentation?
    - What are the primary data sources (e.g., public APIs, licensed databases, web scraping) that need to be integrated? Are there any specific access credentials or legal considerations for these sources?
    - What is the expected volume and frequency of report generation?
    - Are there any specific LLM providers or models preferred for integration (e.g., Google's Gemini, OpenAI's GPT, etc.)?
    - What is the desired level of "personalization" in reports? Does it involve specific user profiles, or is it based on input parameters for custom report generation?
    - What is the budget allocation for LLM API usage and data source subscriptions?

### Risk Assessment
- **Potential Technical Risks:**
    - **LLM Hallucinations and Inaccuracy:** LLMs can generate factually incorrect or misleading information, which is critical for market research reports.
    - **Data Quality and Bias:** The quality, completeness, and bias of the input data can significantly impact the accuracy and fairness of the generated insights.
    - **Computational Cost of LLMs:** Extensive usage of LLMs for detailed analysis can incur high computational and financial costs.
    - **Integration Complexity:** Integrating with diverse and potentially disparate data sources may pose significant technical challenges.
    - **Scalability Bottlenecks:** Poor architectural design or inefficient data pipelines could lead to performance bottlenecks as data volume and request frequency increase.
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **LLM Output Validation:** Implement robust post-processing and validation steps (e.g., cross-referencing with reliable sources, human-in-the-loop review) to mitigate hallucinations and ensure accuracy.
    - **Data Governance and Cleansing:** Establish strong data governance policies, implement data quality checks, and employ data cleansing techniques to ensure the reliability of input data. Diversify data sources to reduce bias.
    - **Cost Optimization:** Implement intelligent LLM prompting strategies, leverage efficient model architectures, and explore tiered LLM usage (e.g., smaller models for initial analysis, larger for synthesis) to optimize costs.
    - **Modular Architecture and APIs:** Design the framework with a modular architecture and well-defined APIs to simplify integration with various data sources and enable phased development.
    - **Scalability by Design:** Utilize cloud-native services, microservices architecture, and horizontally scalable components from the outset. Implement robust monitoring and auto-scaling mechanisms.
