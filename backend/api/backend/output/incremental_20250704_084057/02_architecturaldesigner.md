## System Architecture Design

### High-Level Architecture

The system will adopt a **Layered Monolithic Architecture** to ensure a clear separation of concerns while maintaining the simplicity and lightweight nature required. Given the emphasis on "simple," "single-user," and "file-based storage," a complex distributed system (like microservices) is not warranted.

**Overall System Design and Components:**

1.  **Presentation Layer (User Interface):** This layer interacts directly with the user. It will be a command-line interface (CLI) initially, providing a simple, text-based interaction for defining, executing, and reporting tests. A lightweight GUI (e.g., using Tkinter or PyQt for Python) could be an optional future enhancement but is not the primary focus for "simple."
2.  **Application Layer:** This layer orchestrates the application's core logic. It manages workflows, handles user requests from the Presentation Layer, and coordinates with the Domain and Infrastructure Layers. It implements the use cases (e.g., "Define Test Case," "Execute Test Case," "Generate Report").
3.  **Domain Layer (Core Business Logic):** This is the heart of the application, containing the business rules and domain entities (e.g., `TestCase`, `TestExecutionResult`). It is independent of external concerns like UI or data storage. This layer ensures data integrity and consistency based on the defined business rules.
4.  **Infrastructure Layer (Data Persistence & Utilities):** This layer provides generic technical capabilities such as data storage (file I/O), logging, and other utilities. It implements the interfaces defined in the Domain Layer, allowing the core business logic to remain agnostic to the specific storage mechanism.

### Component Design

**Core Components and Their Responsibilities:**

1.  **`TestCaseManager` (Application Layer):**
    *   **Responsibility:** Manages the lifecycle of test case definitions (CRUD operations).
    *   **Interface:**
        *   `create_test_case(name: str, steps: List[str], expected_results: str) -> TestCaseId`
        *   `get_test_case(test_case_id: TestCaseId) -> TestCase`
        *   `update_test_case(test_case_id: TestCaseId, new_data: dict) -> bool`
        *   `delete_test_case(test_case_id: TestCaseId) -> bool`
        *   `list_test_cases() -> List[TestCase]`
    *   **Interactions:** Uses `TestCaseRepository` (from Infrastructure) to persist and retrieve `TestCase` entities.

2.  **`TestRunner` (Application Layer):**
    *   **Responsibility:** Guides the user through test execution steps, collects actual results and outcomes.
    *   **Interface:**
        *   `run_test_case(test_case_id: TestCaseId) -> TestExecutionResultId`
        *   `record_result(test_execution_result_id: TestExecutionResultId, outcome: TestOutcome, comments: str, evidence_path: Optional[str]) -> bool`
    *   **Interactions:** Uses `TestCaseRepository` to get test details, and `TestExecutionResultRepository` to save execution outcomes. Interacts with the `Presentation Layer` for user input during execution.

3.  **`ReportGenerator` (Application Layer):**
    *   **Responsibility:** Aggregates test definition and execution data to generate summary reports.
    *   **Interface:**
        *   `generate_summary_report() -> ReportData` (e.g., counts of Pass/Fail/Skipped/Blocked)
        *   `generate_detailed_report() -> DetailedReportData` (e.g., list of failed tests with comments)
    *   **Interactions:** Uses `TestCaseRepository` and `TestExecutionResultRepository` to retrieve all necessary data.

4.  **`TestCase` (Domain Layer - Entity):**
    *   **Responsibility:** Represents a single test case definition.
    *   **Attributes:** `id` (unique identifier), `name`, `steps` (list of strings), `expected_results`.
    *   **Methods:** `to_dict()`, `from_dict()`.

5.  **`TestExecutionResult` (Domain Layer - Entity):**
    *   **Responsibility:** Represents the outcome of a single test case execution.
    *   **Attributes:** `id` (unique identifier), `test_case_id` (foreign key), `timestamp`, `outcome` (enum: Pass, Fail, Blocked, Skipped), `comments`, `evidence_path` (optional string path).
    *   **Methods:** `to_dict()`, `from_dict()`.

6.  **`TestCaseRepository` (Infrastructure Layer - Implementation of Domain Interface):**
    *   **Responsibility:** Handles persistence for `TestCase` entities (e.g., reading/writing JSON files).
    *   **Interface (abstracted in Domain Layer, implemented here):**
        *   `save(test_case: TestCase) -> None`
        *   `find_by_id(test_case_id: TestCaseId) -> Optional[TestCase]`
        *   `find_all() -> List[TestCase]`
        *   `delete(test_case_id: TestCaseId) -> bool`

7.  **`TestExecutionResultRepository` (Infrastructure Layer - Implementation of Domain Interface):**
    *   **Responsibility:** Handles persistence for `TestExecutionResult` entities.
    *   **Interface (abstracted in Domain Layer, implemented here):**
        *   `save(result: TestExecutionResult) -> None`
        *   `find_by_id(result_id: TestExecutionResultId) -> Optional[TestExecutionResult]`
        *   `find_all() -> List[TestExecutionResult]`
        *   `find_by_test_case_id(test_case_id: TestCaseId) -> List[TestExecutionResult]`

**Data Flow Between Components:**

*   **Defining a Test Case:**
    1.  User input (CLI/GUI) is received by `Presentation Layer`.
    2.  `Presentation Layer` calls `TestCaseManager.create_test_case()`.
    3.  `TestCaseManager` creates a `TestCase` entity and calls `TestCaseRepository.save()`.
    4.  `TestCaseRepository` writes the `TestCase` data to the `test_cases.json` file.

*   **Executing a Test Case:**
    1.  User selects a test to run via `Presentation Layer`.
    2.  `Presentation Layer` calls `TestRunner.run_test_case()`.
    3.  `TestRunner` retrieves `TestCase` details from `TestCaseRepository`.
    4.  `TestRunner` guides user through steps (via `Presentation Layer`).
    5.  User provides outcome, comments, and optional evidence path.
    6.  `TestRunner` creates `TestExecutionResult` entity and calls `TestExecutionResultRepository.save()`.
    7.  `TestExecutionResultRepository` writes the result data to the `test_results.json` file.

*   **Generating a Report:**
    1.  User requests a report via `Presentation Layer`.
    2.  `Presentation Layer` calls `ReportGenerator.generate_summary_report()`.
    3.  `ReportGenerator` retrieves all `TestCase`s from `TestCaseRepository` and all `TestExecutionResult`s from `TestExecutionResultRepository`.
    4.  `ReportGenerator` processes data in-memory and returns the report data to the `Presentation Layer` for display.

### Technology Stack

*   **Programming Language:** Python (Preferred, adheres to `coding_standards.docx`)
*   **Frameworks/Libraries:**
    *   **Standard Library:** For file I/O (`json`, `csv` - though `json` is preferred), basic data structures, logging.
    *   **UUID:** For generating unique identifiers for test cases and results.
    *   **Type Hinting:** For improved code readability and maintainability.
    *   **Optional GUI:** `Tkinter` (standard library, simplest for basic GUI) or `PyQt` (more feature-rich, but external dependency). **Initial focus will be on CLI.**
*   **Databases and Storage Solutions:**
    *   **Test Case Definitions:** `test_cases.json` (JSON file format). Chosen for structured data, readability, and ease of parsing in Python.
    *   **Test Execution Results:** `test_results.json` (JSON file format). Similar reasons as above. Each file will be an array of objects.
*   **Infrastructure and Deployment Considerations:**
    *   **File System:** All data will be stored as flat files within a designated directory structure (e.g., `./data/`).
    *   **Local Execution:** The workflow will be designed as a standalone application, executable directly on Windows, macOS, or Linux via the Python interpreter.
    *   **Packaging (Optional):** `PyInstaller` could be used to create single-file executables for easier distribution to users without a Python environment.

### Design Patterns

*   **Architectural Pattern:**
    *   **Layered Architecture (Monolithic):** Clearly separates concerns into Presentation, Application, Domain, and Infrastructure layers. This promotes maintainability and allows for independent evolution of layers.
*   **Design Patterns for Implementation:**
    *   **Repository Pattern:** Abstract the persistence layer (file I/O) from the domain logic. `TestCaseRepository` and `TestExecutionResultRepository` are concrete implementations of an abstract interface, enabling future migration to a database without changing core logic.
    *   **Factory Method:** For creating `TestCase` and `TestExecutionResult` objects from dictionary representations loaded from JSON files. This centralizes object creation logic.
    *   **Strategy Pattern (Potential Future):** If different reporting formats or execution modes are introduced later, this pattern could allow swapping algorithms for report generation or test execution.
    *   **Dependency Injection (Manual):** Components will receive their dependencies (e.g., `TestCaseManager` receiving `TestCaseRepository` via constructor) rather than creating them internally. This improves testability and flexibility.
    *   **Value Object:** `TestOutcome` (Pass, Fail, Blocked, Skipped) can be implemented as an Enum, acting as a value object to ensure type safety and restrict valid outcomes.

### Quality Attributes

*   **Scalability:**
    *   **Design for Current Scope:** The use of JSON files is appropriate for the stated scale (up to 100 test cases and results). File I/O will be optimized by reading all necessary data into memory for reporting or processing at once, rather than line-by-line or object-by-object reads.
    *   **Future Scalability:** The Repository Pattern and clear Layered Architecture provide a strong foundation for future scaling. Should the requirements exceed 100 test cases significantly, the Infrastructure Layer can be replaced with a database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL) without affecting the Application or Domain layers.
    *   **Performance Mitigation:** For report generation, all relevant data will be loaded into memory once and then processed, rather than repeatedly accessing files, ensuring reports generate within 5 seconds for the specified scale.

*   **Security Considerations:**
    *   **Data Integrity:**
        *   JSON schema validation (or simple Python dictionary validation) will be implemented upon loading data from files to ensure correctness and prevent malformed data from corrupting the application state.
        *   Data will be validated before writing to files.
        *   Unique identifiers (UUIDs) will be used for test cases and results to prevent ID conflicts.
    *   **Access Control:** As per requirements, no user authentication or authorization is required for this "simple" workflow. It assumes a trusted, single-user, or small co-located team environment. File system permissions (managed by the OS) are the primary security mechanism.
    *   **Evidence Handling:** Evidence paths will be stored as strings. The system will not directly execute or process these paths beyond storing them, mitigating risks related to arbitrary code execution from malicious paths.

*   **Performance Optimizations:**
    *   **In-Memory Processing:** For operations like reporting, all necessary test case definitions and results will be loaded into memory once. Subsequent filtering, aggregation, and formatting will occur in-memory, minimizing repeated disk I/O.
    *   **Efficient Serialization:** Python's built-in `json` module is efficient for small-to-medium JSON files.
    *   **Minimizing Disk Writes:** Data will be written to disk only when explicitly saved or updated, not on every small change, to reduce I/O overhead.
    *   **Optimized Data Structures:** Using appropriate Python data structures (e.g., dictionaries for quick lookups by ID) will ensure fast access to in-memory data.

*   **Maintainability Features:**
    *   **Clear Layer Separation:** Enforces separation of concerns, making it easier to understand, debug, and modify specific parts of the system without affecting others.
    *   **Modular Design:** Each component has a single, well-defined responsibility, promoting the Single Responsibility Principle.
    *   **Clean Code Principles:** Adherence to Python's PEP 8 guidelines and the organization's `coding_standards.docx` will ensure consistent, readable, and maintainable code.
    *   **Type Hinting:** Improves code clarity, aids in static analysis, and reduces bugs.
    *   **Testability:** The Dependency Injection pattern and clear component interfaces facilitate unit testing of individual components (especially Application and Domain layers) in isolation.
    *   **Self-Documenting Code:** Emphasis on clear variable names, function names, and concise comments where necessary.
