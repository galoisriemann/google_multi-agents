# Simple Test Workflow

## Overview
The Simple Test Workflow is a lightweight, command-line interface (CLI) application designed to facilitate manual functional testing. It allows users to define individual test cases, execute them, record their outcomes, and generate basic summary reports. This tool is ideal for single users or small, co-located teams requiring a straightforward approach to test management without the overhead of complex test automation frameworks or databases.

**Key Features:**
*   **Test Case Definition:** Easily define test cases with unique identifiers, names, detailed steps, and expected results.
*   **Test Case Execution:** Manually step through defined test cases and record actual outcomes.
*   **Test Result Recording:** Capture test results (Pass, Fail, Blocked, Skipped) along with comments and optional evidence paths.
*   **Basic Reporting:** Generate summary and detailed reports of test execution results, focusing on the latest outcome for each test case.
*   **File-Based Storage:** Utilizes simple JSON files for persistent storage of test definitions and results, ensuring portability and ease of management for small-scale projects (up to ~100 test cases).

## Installation
To set up and run the Simple Test Workflow application, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository** (or manually create the project structure):
    If using Git:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd simple-test-workflow
    ```
    If creating manually:
    Create a main project directory (e.g., `project/`). Navigate into it.
    ```bash
    mkdir -p src/domain src/infrastructure src/application data tests
    touch src/__init__.py src/domain/__init__.py src/infrastructure/__init__.py src/application/__init__.py
    ```

2.  **Populate the files** with the provided Python code. Ensure the `src/config.py` file is created first, then `src/main.py` and the other modules, followed by the test files.

    *   `project/src/config.py`
    *   `project/src/domain/enums.py`
    *   `project/src/domain/entities.py`
    *   `project/src/infrastructure/file_utils.py`
    *   `project/src/infrastructure/repositories.py`
    *   `project/src/application/test_case_manager.py`
    *   `project/src/application/test_runner.py`
    *   `project/src/application/report_generator.py`
    *   `project/src/main.py`
    *   `project/tests/test_domain.py`
    *   `project/tests/test_infrastructure.py`
    *   `project/tests/test_application.py`

3.  **Python Requirement:** Ensure you have **Python 3.6 or higher** installed on your system.

## Quick Start
To launch the application:

1.  Navigate to the root of your `project/` directory in your terminal.
2.  Run the main script:
    ```bash
    python -m src.main
    ```
    This will launch the interactive command-line menu.

### Basic Usage Flow:

1.  **Define New Test Case:**
    *   Select option `1` from the main menu.
    *   Follow the prompts to enter the test case name, execution steps (type `done` to finish steps), and expected results.

2.  **List All Test Cases:**
    *   Select option `2` to view all currently defined test cases with their details.

3.  **Run Test Case:**
    *   Select option `3`.
    *   Choose a test case by its number from the displayed list.
    *   The application will present each step. Press Enter after completing each step.
    *   Review the expected results.
    *   Select the outcome (Pass, Fail, Blocked, Skipped) by entering the corresponding number.
    *   Optionally add comments and a path to evidence.

4.  **View Test Report:**
    *   Select option `4` to generate and display both a summary report (counts of Pass/Fail/etc.) and a detailed report showing the latest result for each test case.

## Features
The Simple Test Workflow provides the following core functionalities:

### Test Case Definition
Users can define new test cases by providing:
*   A descriptive **Name**: A brief title for the test.
*   **Execution Steps**: A detailed, ordered list of actions to perform during testing. The system allows multiple steps to be entered sequentially until "done" is typed.
*   **Expected Results**: A clear description of the anticipated outcome if the test case is executed successfully.

All defined test cases are stored in `data/test_cases.json`.

### Test Case Execution
The application guides the user through the execution of a selected test case:
*   Users are presented with a list of available test cases and can choose one by number.
*   Each step of the chosen test case is displayed sequentially, requiring user confirmation (pressing Enter) before proceeding to the next step.
*   After all steps, the expected results are displayed for review.

### Test Result Recording
Following execution, users can record the outcome:
*   **Outcome Selection**: Users select from predefined outcomes: `Pass`, `Fail`, `Blocked`, or `Skipped`.
*   **Comments**: An optional free-text field for additional notes or observations.
*   **Evidence Path**: An optional field to link to external evidence (e.g., a screenshot file path) related to the test execution.

All recorded execution results are stored in `data/test_results.json`. The system records each execution as a new entry, maintaining a history.

### Basic Reporting
The system offers two types of reports:
*   **Summary Report**: Provides aggregated counts of test outcomes (Passed, Failed, Blocked, Skipped) based on the *latest* execution result for each defined test case. It also counts test cases that have not yet been run.
*   **Detailed Report**: Lists each defined test case and its *latest* execution result, including outcome, timestamp, comments, and evidence path (if available). If a test case has no recorded runs, it will indicate "No runs recorded yet."
```

## Examples

### 1. Defining a Test Case using `TestCaseManager`

```python
from src.infrastructure.repositories import JSONFileTestCaseRepository
from src.application.test_case_manager import TestCaseManager
from src.config import TEST_CASES_FILE

# Initialize the repository and manager
test_case_repo = JSONFileTestCaseRepository(TEST_CASES_FILE)
test_case_manager = TestCaseManager(test_case_repo)

# Define a new test case
try:
    new_test_case = test_case_manager.create_test_case(
        name="Verify User Login",
        steps=[
            "1. Navigate to login page.",
            "2. Enter valid username.",
            "3. Enter valid password.",
            "4. Click 'Login' button."
        ],
        expected_results="User is successfully logged in and redirected to dashboard."
    )
    print(f"Created Test Case: {new_test_case.name} (ID: {new_test_case.id})")

    # List all test cases
    all_test_cases = test_case_manager.list_test_cases()
    print("\nAll Test Cases:")
    for tc in all_test_cases:
        print(f"- {tc.name} (ID: {tc.id})")

except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

### 2. Recording a Test Result using `TestRunner`

```python
from src.infrastructure.repositories import JSONFileTestCaseRepository, JSONFileTestExecutionResultRepository
from src.application.test_runner import TestRunner
from src.domain.enums import TestOutcome
from src.config import TEST_CASES_FILE, TEST_RESULTS_FILE
import uuid # For a dummy test_case_id if not creating first
from datetime import datetime

# Assuming a test case with a known ID exists (e.g., from example 1)
# For demonstration, let's use a dummy ID and ensure a Test Case exists in repo
test_case_repo = JSONFileTestCaseRepository(TEST_CASES_FILE)
test_result_repo = JSONFileTestExecutionResultRepository(TEST_RESULTS_FILE)
test_runner = TestRunner(test_case_repo, test_result_repo)

# Ensure a dummy test case exists for this example to run cleanly
# In a real scenario, you would fetch an existing test case ID
dummy_test_case_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
from src.domain.entities import TestCase
tc = TestCase(dummy_test_case_id, "Example Test", ["Step 1"], "Expected Result")
test_case_repo.save(tc) # Save it to make it discoverable by the runner

try:
    # Record a 'Pass' result
    pass_result = test_runner.record_result(
        test_case_id=dummy_test_case_id,
        outcome=TestOutcome.PASS,
        comments="Login successful as expected.",
        evidence_path="/tmp/login_screenshot.png"
    )
    print(f"Recorded Pass Result (ID: {pass_result.id}) for Test Case {pass_result.test_case_id}")

    # Record a 'Fail' result for the same test case (simulating a re-run)
    fail_result = test_runner.record_result(
        test_case_id=dummy_test_case_id,
        outcome=TestOutcome.FAIL,
        comments="Failed to redirect after login, received 500 error.",
        evidence_path="/tmp/error_log.txt"
    )
    print(f"Recorded Fail Result (ID: {fail_result.id}) for Test Case {fail_result.test_case_id}")

except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

### 3. Generating Reports using `ReportGenerator`

```python
from src.infrastructure.repositories import JSONFileTestCaseRepository, JSONFileTestExecutionResultRepository
from src.application.report_generator import ReportGenerator
from src.config import TEST_CASES_FILE, TEST_RESULTS_FILE

# Initialize repositories and generator
test_case_repo = JSONFileTestCaseRepository(TEST_CASES_FILE)
test_result_repo = JSONFileTestExecutionResultRepository(TEST_RESULTS_FILE)
report_generator = ReportGenerator(test_case_repo, test_result_repo)

# Generate and print summary report
summary = report_generator.generate_summary_report()
print("\n--- Summary Report ---")
for key, value in summary.items():
    print(f"{key.replace('_', ' ').title()}: {value}")

# Generate and print detailed report
detailed = report_generator.generate_detailed_report()
print("\n--- Detailed Report ---")
if not detailed:
    print("No test results to display in detailed report.")
else:
    for item in detailed:
        print(f"\nTest Case: {item['test_case_name']} (ID: {item['test_case_id']})")
        if item['last_result']:
            result = item['last_result']
            print(f"  Last Run: {result['timestamp']}")
            print(f"  Outcome: {result['outcome']}")
            if result['comments']:
                print(f"  Comments: {result['comments']}")
            if result['evidence_path']:
                print(f"  Evidence: {result['evidence_path']}")
        else:
            print("  No runs recorded yet.")
```
```

### User Guide
```markdown
# User Guide

This guide provides instructions on how to use the Simple Test Workflow application effectively for your manual testing needs.

## Getting Started

1.  **Installation:** Follow the detailed [Installation](#installation) steps in the `README.md` to set up the project and ensure all files are in place.
2.  **Running the Application:** Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the root directory of the project (where the `src/` and `data/` folders are located), and run:
    ```bash
    python -m src.main
    ```
    The application will initialize the `data/` directory (if it doesn't exist) and create empty `test_cases.json` and `test_results.json` files. You will then see the main menu.

## Basic Usage

The application is entirely menu-driven via the command line.

### 1. Define New Test Case
This option allows you to create a new test case definition.

*   From the main menu, type `1` and press Enter.
*   **Enter test case name:** Provide a concise, descriptive name for your test case (e.g., "Login with Valid Credentials").
*   **Enter execution steps:** You will be prompted to enter each step one by one.
    *   Type a step (e.g., "Navigate to the homepage.") and press Enter.
    *   Continue adding steps. When you have entered all steps, type `done` (case-insensitive) on a new line and press Enter.
    *   *Requirement*: At least one step is required.
*   **Enter expected results:** Describe what should happen if the test passes (e.g., "User is redirected to the dashboard and sees their profile icon.").
*   The system will confirm the creation of your test case with its unique ID.

### 2. List All Test Cases
This option displays all test cases currently defined in the system.

*   From the main menu, type `2` and press Enter.
*   The application will list each test case, showing its ID, Name, Steps, and Expected Results. If no test cases are defined, it will inform you.

### 3. Run Test Case
This option guides you through the execution of a selected test case and allows you to record its result.

*   From the main menu, type `3` and press Enter.
*   **Select Test Case:** A list of available test cases will be shown with numbers. Enter the number corresponding to the test case you wish to run and press Enter.
    *   If you enter invalid input (e.g., text or a number out of range), the system will prompt you again until valid input is given or you abandon the operation.
*   **Execute Steps:** For each step of the selected test case, the application will display the step description. Perform the action described, then press Enter to proceed to the next step.
*   **Review Expected Results:** After all steps, the `Expected Results` will be shown. Review them against what actually happened during your manual execution. Press Enter to continue to result recording.
*   **Record Test Result:**
    *   **Select Outcome:** You will be presented with a list of outcome options (Pass, Fail, Blocked, Skipped) with corresponding numbers. Enter the number that best describes the test's outcome and press Enter.
        *   If an invalid choice is made, it will default to 'Blocked'.
    *   **Add comments (optional):** Enter any relevant comments, observations, or details about the execution. Press Enter to finish.
    *   **Path to evidence (optional):** If you captured a screenshot, log file, or other evidence, type its file path here. Press Enter to finish (leave blank if no evidence).
*   The system will confirm that the test result has been recorded with its unique ID and outcome.

### 4. View Test Report
This option generates and displays a summary and detailed report of your test execution results.

*   From the main menu, type `4` and press Enter.
*   **Summary Report:** This section provides an overview:
    *   `Total Test Cases`: Count of all defined test cases.
    *   `Passed`, `Failed`, `Blocked`, `Skipped`: Counts of test cases based on their *latest* recorded outcome.
    *   `Not Run`: Count of test cases that have been defined but never executed.
*   **Detailed Report (Last Result Per Test Case):** This section provides more granular information:
    *   Each defined test case is listed.
    *   For each, it shows its name and ID.
    *   If the test case has been run, it displays the `Last Run` timestamp, `Outcome`, `Comments`, and `Evidence` path from its most recent execution.
    *   If a test case has not been run, it will indicate "No runs recorded yet."

## Advanced Usage

This application is designed for simplicity and manual testing. It does *not* include features such as:
*   Test automation framework integration.
*   Complex reporting dashboards with historical trends.
*   User authentication or role-based access control.
*   Integration with external defect tracking systems.
*   Version control for test cases within the application (external tools like Git are recommended for test asset management).

For these advanced needs, consider migrating to a more comprehensive Test Management System (TMS) or integrating with dedicated automation tools.

## Best Practices

*   **Clear Test Case Names:** Use names that clearly indicate the purpose of the test (e.g., "Login - Valid Credentials", "Search Functionality - Empty Query").
*   **Atomic Steps:** Break down execution steps into small, actionable units. This makes tests easier to follow and execute.
*   **Precise Expected Results:** Be specific about what constitutes a "Pass." Avoid vague descriptions.
*   **Descriptive Comments for Failures:** When a test fails or is blocked, provide detailed comments on *what* went wrong, *why* it failed, and *any relevant context*. This is crucial for debugging and reporting.
*   **Consistent Evidence:** If your workflow requires evidence (screenshots, logs), ensure you consistently capture and link them, especially for failures.
*   **Regular Reporting:** Generate reports regularly to track progress and identify areas needing attention.
*   **Backup Data:** Since data is stored in plain JSON files, consider regularly backing up your `data/` directory to prevent accidental data loss.

## Troubleshooting

*   **"CRITICAL ERROR: Unable to set up data storage..."**
    *   **Cause:** The application could not create the `data/` directory or the `test_cases.json`/`test_results.json` files.
    *   **Solution:** Check the permissions of the directory where you are running the application. Ensure you have write access. Also, check for sufficient disk space.
*   **"Error decoding JSON from <file_path>: ..." or "File might be corrupted."**
    *   **Cause:** One of your data JSON files (`test_cases.json` or `test_results.json`) has become corrupted (e.g., manually edited incorrectly, or an application crash during write). The application will log an `ERROR` and attempt to continue by treating the file as empty.
    *   **Solution:**
        1.  Check the logged error messages for details.
        2.  Navigate to your `data/` directory.
        3.  Inspect the problematic JSON file using a text editor. Look for syntax errors (missing commas, brackets, etc.).
        4.  If you can identify and fix the corruption, save the file.
        5.  If the file is severely corrupted and you have no backup, you might need to delete it. The application will recreate an empty one on next launch, but you will lose data. **This highlights the importance of regular backups.**
*   **"Invalid choice. Please try again." (Main Menu)**
    *   **Cause:** You entered a character or number that is not one of the available menu options (1-5).
    *   **Solution:** Enter only the valid numeric choice (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5).
*   **"Invalid input. Please enter a valid number." (When selecting test case or outcome)**
    *   **Cause:** You entered text or a non-numeric value when a number was expected.
    *   **Solution:** Enter only the numeric option corresponding to your choice. The application will keep prompting until a valid number is entered or you cancel the operation (not explicitly supported for all prompts, but typically by Ctrl+C).
*   **"Error running test case: Test Case with ID '...' not found."**
    *   **Cause:** The test case you attempted to run (by its number) was either deleted or never existed. This can happen if you selected a number corresponding to an empty slot or a test case that was removed by another process.
    *   **Solution:** Go back to the "List All Test Cases" option (2) to see the current list of available test cases and their valid numbers.
*   **Application crashes unexpectedly:**
    *   **Cause:** While error handling is implemented, unforeseen issues or very severe file corruption could lead to a crash.
    *   **Solution:** Check the terminal for any Python traceback. Review the `logs` (if you configure dedicated logging to a file). Report the issue with as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce, and the exact error message/traceback. Ensure your Python environment is correctly set up.

# Developer Guide

This guide provides an overview of the system's architecture, design decisions, and instructions for developers who wish to understand, contribute to, or extend the Simple Test Workflow application.

## Architecture Overview

The Simple Test Workflow employs a **Layered Monolithic Architecture**. This design separates the application into distinct, logical layers, promoting modularity, separation of concerns, and maintainability, while keeping the overall system simple and self-contained.

```mermaid
graph TD
    User -- Interacts with --> PresentationLayer
    PresentationLayer -- Calls use cases --> ApplicationLayer
    ApplicationLayer -- Invokes domain logic --> DomainLayer
    DomainLayer -- Uses interfaces from --> InfrastructureLayer
    InfrastructureLayer -- Stores/Retrieves data from --> DataStorage(JSON/CSV Files)

    subgraph Layers
        PresentationLayer[Presentation Layer<br>(CLI/Simple GUI)]
        ApplicationLayer[Application Layer<br>(Use Cases, Orchestration)]
        DomainLayer[Domain Layer<br>(Entities, Business Logic)]
        InfrastructureLayer[Infrastructure Layer<br>(Data Persistence, Utilities)]
    end
```

**Layers and Their Responsibilities:**

1.  **Presentation Layer (`src/main.py`):**
    *   **Responsibility:** Handles user interaction (Command-Line Interface). It's the entry point of the application.
    *   **Key Components:** `main_menu()`, `define_test_case()`, `run_test_case_workflow()`, `view_test_report()`.
    *   **Interaction:** Calls methods in the `Application Layer` to perform tasks and displays results to the user. Includes basic input validation and error display for user-facing issues.

2.  **Application Layer (`src/application/`):**
    *   **Responsibility:** Orchestrates the application's core logic and defines the use cases. It acts as an intermediary between the Presentation and Domain/Infrastructure layers.
    *   **Key Components:**
        *   `TestCaseManager`: Manages CRUD operations for test case definitions.
        *   `TestRunner`: Facilitates test execution and records results.
        *   `ReportGenerator`: Aggregates data to create summary and detailed reports.
    *   **Interaction:** Depends on `Domain Layer` entities and `Infrastructure Layer` repositories (via abstract interfaces) to implement business workflows.

3.  **Domain Layer (`src/domain/`):**
    *   **Responsibility:** Contains the core business logic, domain entities, and value objects. This layer is independent of external concerns like UI or data storage. It enforces business rules and data integrity.
    *   **Key Components:**
        *   `entities.py`: Defines `TestCase` and `TestExecutionResult` data structures.
        *   `enums.py`: Defines `TestOutcome` enum (Pass, Fail, Blocked, Skipped).
    *   **Interaction:** Provides validated data models to the Application layer and defines abstract interfaces for data persistence (implemented by the Infrastructure layer).

4.  **Infrastructure Layer (`src/infrastructure/`):**
    *   **Responsibility:** Provides generic technical capabilities, particularly data persistence (file I/O) and utilities. It implements the abstract interfaces defined in the `Domain Layer`, allowing the core business logic to remain agnostic to the specific storage mechanism.
    *   **Key Components:**
        *   `file_utils.py`: Contains low-level file reading/writing utilities (`read_json_file`, `write_json_file`).
        *   `repositories.py`: Contains concrete implementations of repository interfaces (`JSONFileTestCaseRepository`, `JSONFileTestExecutionResultRepository`), handling the mapping between domain entities and JSON file storage.
    *   **Interaction:** Depends only on Python's standard library and interacts directly with the file system (`data/` directory).

**Design Patterns Applied:**

*   **Layered Architecture:** Enforces separation of concerns, improving maintainability and scalability.
*   **Repository Pattern:** Abstracted data access (`AbstractTestCaseRepository`, `AbstractTestExecutionResultRepository`) from concrete storage implementations (`JSONFileTestCaseRepository`, `JSONFileTestExecutionResultRepository`). This is crucial for future migration to databases without altering application logic.
*   **Dependency Injection (Manual):** Application layer components receive their dependencies (e.g., `TestCaseManager` receives `test_case_repository` in its constructor) rather than creating them internally. This enhances testability and flexibility.
*   **Factory Method (Implicit):** `from_dict` static methods in domain entities serve as factory methods for object deserialization from dictionaries.
*   **Value Object:** `TestOutcome` enum acts as a value object, ensuring type safety and restricting valid test outcomes.

## Contributing Guidelines

We welcome contributions to the Simple Test Workflow! Please follow these guidelines:

1.  **Understand the Architecture:** Familiarize yourself with the Layered Monolithic Architecture. Changes should adhere to the established layer responsibilities and dependencies.
2.  **Code Style:** Adhere to [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for Python code style. Use clear, descriptive variable and function names.
3.  **Type Hinting:** Use Python [type hints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) for all function arguments, return values, and class attributes where appropriate.
4.  **Docstrings:** Provide comprehensive docstrings for all new modules, classes, and public methods, explaining their purpose, arguments, and return values.
5.  **Testing:**
    *   Write unit tests for new or modified functionality, especially in the `domain`, `infrastructure`, and `application` layers.
    *   Tests should be placed in the `tests/` directory, mirroring the `src/` structure.
    *   Use `unittest.mock` to isolate components during testing, particularly for application layer logic that interacts with repositories.
    *   Ensure existing tests pass before submitting changes.
6.  **Error Handling & Logging:** Utilize Python's `logging` module for internal errors, warnings, and informational messages, rather than `print()`. Provide user-friendly messages for any errors displayed to the console.
7.  **Configuration:** If new configurable paths or settings are needed, add them to `src/config.py`.

## Testing Instructions

The project includes a comprehensive suite of unit tests.

1.  **Navigate to the project root:**
    ```bash
    cd project/ # Or wherever your project directory is located
    ```
2.  **Run all unit tests:**
    ```bash
    python -m unittest discover tests
    ```
    This command will discover and run all test files (`test_*.py`) within the `tests/` directory and its subdirectories.

    Expected output will show `OK` if all tests pass, or details about failures if any occur.

## Deployment Guide

The Simple Test Workflow is designed for local, standalone execution.

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Python 3.6+ installed.
    *   The complete project directory structure with all source code and the `data/` directory.

2.  **Execution Environment:**
    *   The application runs directly from the command line. No web server, database server, or complex environment setup is required.
    *   It creates and manages its own data files (`test_cases.json`, `test_results.json`) within the `data/` directory relative to where `main.py` is executed.

3.  **Data Persistence:**
    *   All test definitions and results are stored in plain JSON files within the `data/` directory.
    *   To migrate data between machines, simply copy the entire `data/` directory.
    *   **Backup Strategy:** It is highly recommended to regularly back up the `data/` directory to prevent data loss. Consider using version control systems (like Git) for test definition files (`test_cases.json`) as well.

4.  **Scalability Considerations:**
    *   The current file-based storage is efficient for the specified scale (up to ~100 test cases).
    *   For larger scales, the performance will degrade due to frequent full file reads/writes.
    *   **Future Upgrade Path:** The architecture (specifically the Repository Pattern) allows for a straightforward migration to a lightweight embedded database (like SQLite) to handle larger datasets, without requiring major changes to the application or domain logic. This would involve creating new `SQLiteTestCaseRepository` and `SQLiteTestExecutionResultRepository` classes and updating the initialization in `src/main.py`.

5.  **Distribution (Optional):**
    *   For easier distribution to users who may not have Python installed, tools like `PyInstaller` can be used to bundle the application into a single executable file.
    *   Example (after installing `pyinstaller` via `pip install pyinstaller`):
        ```bash
        pyinstaller --onefile src/main.py
        # The executable will be in the 'dist/' directory
        ```
    *   Note: Creating single executables can increase the file size and build time.
```

### Quality and Security Notes
```markdown
# Quality and Security Report

## Code Quality Summary
### Score: 9/10

The codebase demonstrates exceptionally high quality, adhering rigorously to modern software engineering principles and Python best practices.

**Strengths:**
*   **Clear Layered Architecture:** Excellent separation of concerns across `domain`, `infrastructure`, and `application` layers, leading to high cohesion and low coupling.
*   **Adherence to SOLID Principles:** Evident in Single Responsibility for classes, Dependency Inversion through abstract repositories, and Open/Closed Principle for extensibility.
*   **Robust Data Handling:** Domain entities include validation; `file_utils.py` handles file I/O errors and corrupted JSON gracefully, logging issues and returning empty data to prevent crashes.
*   **Comprehensive Unit Testing:** A well-structured test suite covers all key layers (domain, infrastructure, application), uses mocks effectively for isolation, and addresses positive flows, edge cases, and error conditions.
*   **Readability and Maintainability:** Consistent type hints, meaningful naming conventions (PEP 8), thorough docstrings, and judicious inline comments significantly enhance code readability and maintainability.
*   **Scalability Foundation:** The Repository Pattern provides a solid base for future migration to more robust data storage (e.g., SQLite) if scalability requirements grow.
*   **Improved CLI User Experience:** Refactored `main.py` with robust numeric input validation and clearer error messages enhances usability.

**Areas for Improvement (Minor for Current Scope):**
*   **Limited Error Recovery (File Operations):** While caught, `file_utils` currently returns empty data on file errors. For mission-critical data, more advanced recovery (e.g., backing up corrupted files) might be considered.
*   **Logging vs. Printing:** Although `logging` is implemented, some `print()` statements for user interaction still exist, which is fine for a CLI but highlights where a dedicated CLI framework could further standardize output.

## Security Assessment
### Score: 6/10 (Within Defined Constraints)

The system's security posture is considered adequate *only* for its explicit design as a "simple, single-user or trusted environment" test workflow. It incorporates good architectural practices and basic data integrity checks. However, fundamental limitations exist due to the deliberate omission of security features not required by its specified scope.

**Critical Issues:**
*   **None identified within the stated scope and requirements.** The absence of authentication/authorization is a design choice.

**Medium Priority Issues:**
*   **Lack of Authentication and Authorization:** **(PRIMARY CONCERN IF CONTEXT CHANGES)** No user login or access control mechanisms are implemented. Anyone with access to the host machine can manipulate test data files directly, posing a significant risk in untrusted or multi-user environments.
*   **Plain Text Data Storage:** All data is stored unencrypted in JSON files. This creates a confidentiality risk if sensitive information is ever introduced into test cases or results. It also presents an integrity risk as data can be easily modified externally.
*   **Information Disclosure (Refined):** While greatly improved by logging, generic `Exception` catching in `main.py` *could* still, in very rare edge cases, expose more internal details than ideal to the console.

**Low Priority Issues:**
*   **Potential for Path Traversal in Evidence Path (Latent):** The `evidence_path` field stores arbitrary user-provided paths. Though currently only stored and displayed, if future features process these paths without validation, it could become a vulnerability.
*   **Hardcoded File Paths (Mitigated by `config.py`):** The initial hardcoding is now centralized in `src/config.py`, improving flexibility, but still relies on relative paths which can be less robust than absolute paths configured at runtime.
*   **Input Handling Robustness (CLI - External Display):** User inputs are not extensively sanitized for characters that could cause issues if rendered in a different context (e.g., HTML, SQL). For a pure CLI, this risk is minimal.

**Security Best Practices Followed:**
*   **Clear Separation of Concerns (Layered Architecture/Repository Pattern):** Promotes data integrity by isolating persistence logic.
*   **UUIDs for Identifiers:** Prevents predictable IDs, a common exploit in systems lacking proper authorization.
*   **Basic Input Validation in Domain Entities:** Ensures data integrity at the object creation level (e.g., non-empty, correct types).
*   **Robust File I/O Error Handling:** `file_utils.py` handles `json.JSONDecodeError` and `IOError`, making the application more resilient to corrupted files and preventing crashes.
*   **Standard Library Usage:** Minimizes attack surface from third-party dependencies.

**Recommendations:**
*   **Explicitly document security assumptions:** Crucially, the documentation must clearly state the trusted environment assumption.
*   **Enhanced Error Reporting:** Continue to refine error logging to ensure sensitive details are never exposed to the end-user.
*   **File Path Validation (Future):** If `evidence_path` is ever processed, implement strict path sanitization (e.g., using `os.path.abspath`, `os.path.normpath`, and directory whitelisting).
*   **External Configuration:** Leveraging `src/config.py` is a good step; further externalization via command-line args or env vars for production-like deployments.

## Performance Characteristics
### Score: 7/10 (Meets NFRs for Current Scope)

The system meets its stated performance requirements for up to 100 test cases and their results, largely due to its lightweight nature. However, its fundamental file-based data access pattern is a significant limiting factor for future scalability.

**Critical Performance Issues (If Scaled Beyond ~100 Test Cases):**
*   **Full File I/O for Every Operation:** The core bottleneck is that most CRUD operations involve reading the *entire* relevant JSON file into memory, performing the change, and then writing the *entire* file back to disk. This linear operation (O(N) where N is file size) becomes highly inefficient for larger datasets.

**Optimization Opportunities (Mainly for Future Scaling):**
1.  **Transition to an Embedded Database (Primary Recommendation):** For scales beyond 100 test cases, migrate the `infrastructure/repositories.py` layer to use a lightweight embedded database like **SQLite**. This would provide indexed lookups (O(log N) or O(1)), efficient partial updates, and better transactional integrity, resolving the core I/O bottleneck. The Repository Pattern facilitates this.
2.  **In-Memory Processing for Reports:** The `ReportGenerator` already loads all necessary data into memory once for its calculations, which is efficient for its purpose within the current scale.

**Algorithmic Analysis:**
*   **CRUD Operations (`JSONFileRepositories`):** Dominated by file I/O. Effective time complexity is O(N_records) for reading/writing the entire file.
*   **Report Generation:** O(N_test_cases + N_results) in-memory processing after initial file reads.

**Resource Utilization:**
*   **Memory:** Minimal for the current scope (few MBs).
*   **CPU:** Low.
*   **I/O:** Most taxed resource due to frequent full file reads/writes, though mitigated by SSDs for small files.

**Scalability Assessment:**
The current design is **not inherently scalable beyond the stated "up to 100 test cases" limit.** Any significant increase in test cases or results will lead to noticeable performance degradation as file sizes grow. Horizontal scaling is not applicable. Vertical scaling (more RAM/CPU) offers limited benefit against the fundamental I/O pattern.

**Recommendations:**
*   **Prioritize Database Migration for Future Scale:** Clearly communicate this limitation and recommend SQLite migration as the primary path for growth.
*   **Monitoring & Profiling (If Issues Arise):** Use Python's `cProfile` if performance unexpectedly degrades within the expected limits.
*   **Error Handling for File Corruption:** (Addressed in Refactoring) The graceful handling of JSON decoding errors in `file_utils.py` improves resilience, contributing to perceived performance stability.

## Known Limitations

*   **Scalability:** Limited by the flat-file JSON storage, which requires reading/writing entire files for most operations. Not suitable for hundreds or thousands of test cases without migration to a database.
*   **Security (Authentication/Authorization):** Lacks any user authentication or authorization. Designed for single-user or trusted environments only. Data files are vulnerable to direct modification by anyone with file system access.
*   **No Advanced Features:** Does not include features like test automation framework integration, complex reporting dashboards, historical trend analysis (beyond latest result), or integration with external systems (e.g., Jira).
*   **Evidence Management:** Only stores a *path* to evidence; it does not manage, store, or process the evidence files themselves.
*   **Manual Workflow:** Primarily supports manual testing and requires significant user interaction for execution and result recording.

### Changelog
```markdown
# Changelog

## Version History

### Version 1.0.0 (Initial Release - Refactored)
*   **Date:** 2023-10-27
*   **Summary:** Initial stable release incorporating a layered monolithic architecture, file-based data persistence (JSON), and core functionalities for defining, executing, and reporting manual test cases. This version includes significant refactoring for improved quality, security, and performance based on initial reviews.

## Breaking Changes

While minimal, users migrating from an unrefactored version should note:

*   **Configuration File:** File paths for `test_cases.json` and `test_results.json` are now defined in `src/config.py`. If you previously hardcoded these paths elsewhere or relied on implicit locations, you must now adjust your setup to use or import from `src/config.py`.
*   **Error Handling in `file_utils.py`:** The `read_json_file` function in `src/infrastructure/file_utils.py` no longer raises `json.JSONDecodeError` or `IOError` directly for reading failures. Instead, it logs the error and returns an empty list `[]`. If your code explicitly caught these exceptions from this function, you should update your error handling logic.
*   **Console Error Messages:** Detailed technical error messages are now primarily directed to the application's internal logs (if configured) instead of being printed directly to the console. User-facing messages are more general and user-friendly.

## Migration Guides

### Migrating to Version 1.0.0 (from a pre-refactor state)

Follow these steps to ensure a smooth transition to the refactored version:

1.  **Update Project Structure:**
    Ensure your project structure includes the new `src/config.py` file and aligns with the following:
    ```
    project/
    ├── src/
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   ├── main.py
    │   ├── config.py             # <--- NEW FILE
    │   ├── domain/
    │   │   ├── __init__.py
    │   │   ├── entities.py
    │   │   └── enums.py
    │   ├── infrastructure/
    │   │   ├── __init__.py
    │   │   ├── repositories.py
    │   │   └── file_utils.py
    │   ├── application/
    │   │   ├── __init__.py
    │   │   ├── test_case_manager.py
    │   │   ├── test_runner.py
    │   │   └── report_generator.py
    ├── data/
    │   ├── test_cases.json
    │   └── test_results.json
    └── tests/
        ├── test_domain.py
        ├── test_infrastructure.py
        └── test_application.py
    ```

2.  **Replace File Contents:**
    *   **`src/config.py`**: Create this new file and copy its entire content as provided in the refactored code.
    *   **`src/main.py`**: Replace the entire content of your existing `main.py` with the refactored `main.py` code.
    *   **`src/infrastructure/file_utils.py`**: Replace the entire content of your existing `file_utils.py` with the refactored `file_utils.py` code.
    *   **`tests/test_infrastructure.py`**: Replace the entire content of your existing `test_infrastructure.py` with the updated `test_infrastructure.py` code.
    *   All other files (`src/domain/*.py`, `src/infrastructure/repositories.py`, `src/application/*.py`, `tests/test_domain.py`, `tests/test_application.py`) remain unchanged in terms of their code content, but ensure they are present in the correct paths.

3.  **Data File Location:**
    The application now strictly expects `test_cases.json` and `test_results.json` to be located within a `data/` directory, directly inside your `project/` root.
    *   If you have existing `test_cases.json` or `test_results.json` files from a previous run, **move them into the `project/data/` directory.**
    *   If you wish to place data files elsewhere, you *must* edit `src/config.py` to update the `DATA_DIR`, `TEST_CASES_FILE`, and `TEST_RESULTS_FILE` variables accordingly.

4.  **Logging Configuration:**
    The `main.py` now includes basic logging configuration. If you require more advanced logging (e.g., writing logs to a specific file, setting different log levels for various modules), you can modify the `logging.basicConfig` call in `main.py` or implement a more elaborate logging setup.

5.  **Running the Application and Tests:**
    *   **To run the application:** Navigate to your `project/` directory and execute:
        ```bash
        python -m src.main
        ```
    *   **To run the unit tests:** Navigate to your `project/` directory and execute:
        ```bash
        python -m unittest discover tests
        ```

**Important Security Note for Users:**

This Simple Test Workflow is explicitly designed for a **single-user or trusted, local environment**. It is crucial to understand its inherent limitations:

*   **No Authentication/Authorization:** The application does not implement any form of user login or access control. Anyone with direct access to the machine where the application is running can define, execute, modify, and delete test cases and their results.
*   **Plain-Text Data Storage:** All test case definitions and execution results are stored unencrypted in plain-text JSON files. Therefore, **sensitive or confidential information should absolutely NOT be stored within this system.**
*   **Reliance on OS Permissions:** The security of your data relies entirely on the operating system's file system permissions on the `data/` directory and the application files.

**If your environment is not trusted, involves multiple users, or requires the handling of sensitive data, this tool is NOT suitable. A more robust solution with built-in security controls (e.g., a database with access control, encryption, user management) would be required.**
