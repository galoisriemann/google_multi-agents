## Requirements Analysis

### Functional Requirements
- **Test Case Definition:** The system must allow users to define individual test cases, including a unique identifier, a descriptive name, a detailed set of execution steps, and clear expected results.
- **Test Case Execution:** The system must facilitate the execution of defined test cases, allowing users to follow the steps and observe the actual outcomes.
- **Test Result Recording:** The system must enable users to record the outcome of each test case execution (e.g., Pass, Fail, Blocked, Skipped) and optionally add comments or attach evidence.
- **Basic Reporting:** The system must generate a simple report summarizing the test execution results (e.g., total tests, passed, failed, blocked, skipped counts).

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance requirements:**
    - Test case definition and result recording should be responsive, with operations completing within 1-2 seconds.
    - Basic test reports should be generated within 5 seconds for a small set of test cases (e.g., up to 100).
- **Security requirements:**
    - The workflow should ensure data integrity for test definitions and results.
    - No specific user authentication or authorization is required for this "simple" workflow, assuming a single-user or trusted environment.
- **Scalability requirements:**
    - The workflow should be able to manage up to 100 test cases and their respective execution results without significant performance degradation.
- **Usability requirements:**
    - The interface for defining, executing, and recording results should be intuitive and easy to understand for users with basic technical proficiency.
    - Clear instructions or prompts should guide the user through the workflow steps.

### Technical Constraints
- **Technology stack preferences:**
    - Python is preferred for implementation, aligning with the "Good Coding Practices" document (coding_standards.docx).
    - Lightweight data storage mechanisms such as CSV, JSON files, or simple flat files should be used for test case definitions and results.
- **Platform constraints:**
    - The workflow should be runnable on common operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).
- **Integration requirements:**
    - No external system integrations are required for this simple workflow.

### Assumptions and Clarifications
- **Assumptions made:**
    - The "simple test workflow" primarily focuses on manual or script-assisted functional testing.
    - The target user base is a single individual or a small, co-located team.
    - Test case management and execution are not expected to be highly automated; manual input will be involved.
    - The scope does not include advanced features like test automation frameworks, continuous integration, or complex reporting dashboards.
    - Version control for test assets (test case definitions) will be managed externally (e.g., Git) if needed, rather than by the workflow itself.
- **Questions that need clarification:**
    - What is the expected format for defining test cases (e.g., text file, spreadsheet, simple GUI input)?
    - How will "evidence" for test failures be captured and linked (e.g., screenshot paths, text logs)?
    - What level of detail is expected in the "basic report" (e.g., just counts, or a list of failed tests with comments)?
    - Are there any specific naming conventions or directory structures to follow for test assets beyond what's in `coding_standards.docx`?

### Risk Assessment
- **Potential technical risks:**
    - **Data Corruption:** Using simple file-based storage without robust error handling could lead to data corruption if the application crashes or is improperly shut down.
    - **Lack of Version Control for Test Assets:** If test case definitions are not managed under a version control system (e.g., Git), changes can be lost or overwritten, and traceability becomes difficult.
    - **Scalability Limitations:** As the number of test cases or executions grows, the simple file-based approach might become inefficient, leading to performance bottlenecks.
- **Mitigation strategies:**
    - **Data Corruption:** Implement basic error handling and data validation before writing to files. Consider using a simple, well-structured format like JSON to reduce parsing errors. Regularly back up test data.
    - **Lack of Version Control:** Recommend storing test definition files within a version-controlled repository (e.g., Git, as mentioned in `coding_standards.docx`).
    - **Scalability Limitations:** Clearly document the expected scale and advise on migrating to a more robust solution (e.g., a simple database) if requirements exceed the current capabilities.
