## Security Review Report

### Security Score: 8/10

**Rationale:** The proposed system architecture and requirements demonstrate a strong foundational understanding of security principles, especially regarding data encryption, authentication, authorization, and audit trails. The adoption of microservices, event-driven architecture, and managed cloud services inherently contributes to a more secure posture. However, some common pitfalls and advanced security considerations pertinent to AI systems and cloud deployments are not explicitly detailed, warranting a score of 8.

### Critical Issues (High Priority)

1.  **Sensitive Data Masking/Redaction (Data Privacy Risk):** While encryption is mentioned (NFR-S1), there is no explicit requirement or architectural component for automatically identifying and redacting/masking highly sensitive information (e.g., PII, PCI, PHI) *within* documents *before* it's processed by AI services or stored as raw text/analysis results. Without this, sensitive data could be inadvertently exposed in search results, summaries, or reports, posing significant privacy and compliance risks.
2.  **AI Model Security (Adversarial Attacks & Data Poisoning):** The architecture mentions AI model accuracy and bias as a risk (RT2) but lacks specific considerations for securing the AI models themselves against malicious input or manipulation (e.g., adversarial attacks, data poisoning, model stealing). Compromised models could lead to incorrect, biased, or malicious outputs.
3.  **Inter-service Communication Security:** While TLS/SSL is mentioned for "all API endpoints and inter-service communication" in general, the architectural details do not explicitly specify strong authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., mutual TLS - mTLS, JWTs for service accounts) for *internal* microservice communication. Without this, a compromised internal service could potentially impersonate others or gain unauthorized access.
4.  **Secrets Management:** There is no explicit mention of a robust secrets management solution (e.g., for API keys, database credentials, internal service-to-service authentication tokens). Storing secrets insecurely (e.g., hardcoded, in environment variables without protection) is a critical vulnerability.

### Medium Priority Issues

1.  **Comprehensive Input Validation and Output Encoding:** While an API Gateway is in place, the emphasis on rigorous input validation and output encoding for *all* user-supplied data, especially in complex areas like custom report generation (FR3.2) and user feedback for model retraining (FR3.5), needs to be explicitly highlighted. This is crucial for preventing injection attacks (SQL, NoSQL, Command, XSS) and ensuring data integrity.
2.  **Container and Kubernetes Security:** The use of Docker and Kubernetes (AWS EKS) is mentioned. However, the design does not detail specific security measures for container images (e.g., vulnerability scanning, signing), runtime security (e.g., network policies, security context constraints, host security), or Kubernetes cluster hardening.
3.  **Supply Chain Security (Dependencies & Libraries):** While specific libraries are mentioned (TC1.2, TC1.3), there is no explicit strategy for continuously monitoring and managing vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and dependencies (Software Composition Analysis - SCA). This is a significant risk given the reliance on numerous open-source ML/NLP libraries.
4.  **Cloud Configuration Security Auditing:** While AWS is the preferred cloud platform, misconfigurations in cloud services are a leading cause of breaches. There's no explicit mention of continuous security auditing of AWS configurations against benchmarks (e.g., CIS Benchmarks) or the use of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) security scanning tools.
5.  **Detailed Session Management:** NFR-S3 covers authentication, but explicit details on secure session management (e.g., robust token invalidation, short-lived tokens, secure cookie flags like HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite) are important to prevent session hijacking and replay attacks.

### Low Priority Issues

1.  **Generic Error Handling for Information Leakage:** NFR-U2 focuses on clear error messages for usability. From a security perspective, it's crucial to ensure these messages are generic and do not leak sensitive system information (e.g., stack traces, internal file paths, database errors) that could aid an attacker.
2.  **Log Tampering Protection:** While audit trails (NFR-S4) are captured, ensuring the integrity and immutability of these logs (e.g., write-once storage, cryptographic hashing, integration with a SIEM) is important to prevent attackers from covering their tracks.
3.  **HTTP Security Headers:** Explicitly enforcing robust HTTP security headers (e.g., Content Security Policy (CSP), HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS), X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options) for the web UI is a minor but important step to mitigate various client-side attacks.

### Security Best Practices Followed

*   **Microservices Architecture:** Promotes fault isolation and reduces the attack surface for individual services.
*   **Event-Driven Architecture:** Decouples services, enhancing resilience and scalability, which indirectly contributes to security by reducing system bottlenecks.
*   **API Gateway:** Serves as a single, controlled entry point for external requests, enabling centralized authentication, authorization, and rate limiting (partially mentioned).
*   **Data Encryption (NFR-S1):** Explicit commitment to encrypting data at rest (AWS S3 SSE, database encryption) and in transit (TLS/SSL).
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) (NFR-S2):** Implemented via the User Management Service, crucial for fine-grained authorization.
*   **Secure Authentication (NFR-S3):** Support for OAuth 2.0 and consideration of multi-factor authentication (MFA) are strong security features.
*   **Audit Trails (NFR-S4):** Comprehensive logging of user actions and system operations for security auditing and forensic analysis.
*   **Least Privilege Principle:** Mentioned as a design principle, which is fundamental to minimizing potential damage from breaches.
*   **Use of Managed Cloud Services (AWS):** Leveraging AWS services (S3, RDS, EKS, etc.) often provides built-in security features, compliance certifications, and managed patching.
*   **Vulnerability Management Strategy:** Commitment to regular security audits, penetration testing, and adherence to OWASP Top 10.
*   **CI/CD Integration (TC3.2):** Automated pipelines facilitate regular security scanning and rapid patching.

### Recommendations

1.  **Implement Data Masking/Redaction:** Integrate a dedicated service or module (e.g., using specialized NLP libraries or cloud services like AWS Comprehend Medical/PII) within the Document Ingestion or a pre-processing pipeline to identify and redact/mask sensitive information *before* it reaches core AI analysis and storage.
2.  **Secure AI Models:**
    *   Implement **input sanitization** specifically for AI model inputs to mitigate adversarial attacks.
    *   Consider **model monitoring** for anomalies in predictions that might indicate data poisoning or model drift.
    *   Explore techniques like **model quantization/obfuscation** to deter model stealing.
    *   Ensure **model versioning and integrity checks** to prevent unauthorized tampering.
3.  **Harden Inter-service Communication:** Mandate **mutual TLS (mTLS)** for all internal microservice communication within the VPC/private network to ensure strong authentication and encryption between services. Alternatively, use signed JWTs for service-to-service authentication.
4.  **Adopt a Centralized Secrets Management Solution:** Utilize AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault for securely storing and distributing all application and infrastructure secrets, ensuring they are never hardcoded or exposed in configuration files.
5.  **Enforce Strict Input Validation & Output Encoding:** Implement a "never trust user input" policy. Apply robust validation (e.g., allow-listing, regex, schema validation) at the API Gateway and within each microservice for all incoming data. Perform context-aware output encoding for all data displayed in the UI.
6.  **Implement Comprehensive Container Security:**
    *   Integrate **container image vulnerability scanning** (e.g., Clair, Trivy, AWS ECR image scanning) into CI/CD.
    *   Define and enforce **Kubernetes Network Policies** to restrict inter-pod communication based on the principle of least privilege.
    *   Utilize **Pod Security Standards** (or older Pod Security Policies) to enforce security best practices for pods.
    *   Consider a **runtime container security solution** for anomaly detection.
7.  **Integrate Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Automate the scanning of all third-party libraries and dependencies for known vulnerabilities (CVEs) as part of the CI/CD pipeline, and establish a process for timely patching or replacement of vulnerable components.
8.  **Automate Cloud Configuration Audits:** Implement tools (e.g., AWS Config, AWS Security Hub, custom IaC scanning tools like Checkov, Kube-bench) to continuously monitor and enforce security best practices and compliance standards for AWS resources.
9.  **Refine Session Management:** Explicitly define and implement secure session management practices, including appropriate token expiry, a robust token invalidation/revocation mechanism, and strict use of `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite` flags for cookies.
10. **Implement WAF & DDoS Protection:** Explicitly configure a Web Application Firewall (WAF) (e.g., AWS WAF) at the API Gateway level to protect against common web exploits (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS, broken authentication). Also ensure DDoS protection (e.g., AWS Shield) is enabled.

### Compliance Notes

*   **OWASP Top 10 (2021):**
    *   **A01: Broken Access Control:** Addressed by NFR-S2 and RBAC, but rigorous implementation and testing (e.g., penetration testing for vertical/horizontal privilege escalation) are crucial.
    *   **A02: Cryptographic Failures:** Addressed effectively by NFR-S1 (encryption at rest and in transit).
    *   **A03: Injection:** Needs stronger emphasis on comprehensive input validation and output encoding (as per recommendations) to prevent SQL, NoSQL, XSS, and command injections, especially for custom report generation and search.
    *   **A04: Insecure Design:** Microservices and Event-Driven patterns help, but specific design patterns like secure defaults and threat modeling per service are recommended.
    *   **A05: Security Misconfiguration:** Addressed by recommendations on cloud configuration audits and secure container deployment.
    *   **A06: Vulnerable and Outdated Components:** Addressed by recommendations for SCA tools and dependency management.
    *   **A07: Identification and Authentication Failures:** Well addressed by NFR-S3 (OAuth 2.0, MFA), but session management details need refinement.
    *   **A08: Software and Data Integrity Failures:** Covered by encryption and audit trails, but also by supply chain security for AI models and libraries.
    *   **A09: Security Logging and Monitoring Failures:** Well addressed by NFR-S4 (Audit Trails) and proposed centralized logging.
    *   **A10: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Critical to consider if `FR3.3: Continuous Monitoring & Updates` integrates with arbitrary external data sources. Strict validation and network isolation are necessary.

*   **GDPR/CCPA/HIPAA (if applicable):** The lack of explicit data masking/redaction (Critical Issue 1) is a significant compliance gap if documents contain PII, PHI, or other sensitive personal data. The unclarified "Data Retention Policies" (Q4) are also directly relevant to these regulations. Robust audit trails (NFR-S4) are beneficial for compliance.
