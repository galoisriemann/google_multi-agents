Our CI/CD pipeline (e.g., AWS CodePipeline/GitHub Actions) automates the following steps:
1.  **Source Stage:** Detects changes in the Git repository (`develop` branch for integration, `main` for production).
2.  **Build Stage:**
    *   Runs linters, static analysis, and unit tests.
    *   Builds Docker images for each microservice.
    *   Pushes Docker images to AWS ECR (Elastic Container Registry).
    *   Performs container image vulnerability scanning and SCA.
3.  **Test Stage:**
    *   Deploys services to a staging Kubernetes environment.
    *   Runs integration, end-to-end, and performance tests.
    *   Runs security tests (e.g., API security tests, RBAC validation).
4.  **Deployment Stage:**
    *   If all tests pass, the pipeline triggers a deployment to the target environment (e.g., production).
    *   Uses Helm charts to manage Kubernetes deployments, ensuring versioning and rollback capabilities.

### 3. Manual Deployment (for Development/Debugging)
While automated CI/CD is preferred, individual services can be deployed manually for local development or targeted debugging:

1.  **Build Docker Image:**
    ```bash
    cd services/your-service-name
    docker build -t your-service-name:latest .
    ```
2.  **Deploy to Kubernetes (using Helm):**
    Ensure your Helm chart (`charts/your-service-name`) is configured for local or development cluster deployment.
    ```bash
    helm upgrade --install your-service-name charts/your-service-name --set image.tag=latest
    ```
    *Note: Adjust Helm chart values for specific environments (e.g., database endpoints, AWS credentials if not using Secrets Manager).*

### 4. Configuration Management
*   **Environment Variables:** Used for runtime configuration, sensitive values managed by AWS Secrets Manager.
*   **Kubernetes ConfigMaps:** For non-sensitive configuration data that can be shared across pods.
*   **Helm Charts:** Parameterize deployments, allowing environment-specific configurations.

### 5. Monitoring and Logging
*   **Centralized Logging:** All microservices stream logs to AWS CloudWatch Logs or an ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized access and analysis (NFR-S4).
*   **Metrics:** Prometheus and Grafana are used to collect and visualize performance metrics (CPU, memory, network I/O, AI inference times) for all services.
*   **Distributed Tracing:** OpenTelemetry (or AWS X-Ray) is integrated to provide end-to-end visibility of requests across microservices for latency analysis and troubleshooting.

## Performance Characteristics

**Performance Score: 8/10**

**Rationale:** Robust architecture designed for scalability. However, ambitious NFRs for AI/NLP processing speed and potential resource contention require continuous optimization and monitoring.

**Critical Performance Issues & Optimizations:**
1.  **Intense AI/NLP Workloads vs. NFR-P1 (30s document processing):**
    *   **Optimization:** Aggressive AI model optimization (quantization, knowledge distillation, ONNX/TensorRT) and **GPU acceleration** (Phase 2+). Smart batching for AI inference (Phase 2). Stratified AI processing where less critical analysis might run asynchronously.
2.  **Resource Contention during Peak Loads (NFR-P3: 1M documents/month):**
    *   **Optimization:** Continuous performance monitoring with distributed tracing (Phase 2+). Comprehensive load/stress testing (Phase 2+). Refined auto-scaling policies for microservices.
3.  **Python GIL for CPU-Bound Tasks:**
    *   **Mitigation:** Horizontal scaling of AI services (NFR-Sc1) and explicit GPU acceleration (Phase 2+) to maximize per-instance efficiency.

**Optimization Opportunities:**
*   **Targeted Caching:** Redis integration for document metadata, common search queries/results, and aggregated report data (Phase 2+).
*   **Database and Search Engine Tuning:** Continuous optimization of indexing strategies, query performance for Elasticsearch, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB (Phase 1+).
*   **Efficient Inter-Service Communication:** Optimize message sizes, serialization formats, and minimize synchronous calls.
*   **Document Pre-processing Efficiency:** Streamline text extraction and OCR in Document Ingestion Service.

**Algorithmic Analysis (General Complexity):**
*   **Text Extraction:** O(N) where N is document size. OCR adds significant variable overhead.
*   **AI/NLP Analysis:** Can range from O(L) to O(L^2) depending on model and input length (L). Summarization and Information Extraction are typically the most intensive.
*   **Search (Elasticsearch):** O(log N) or O(1) for indexed fields. Indexing is O(D) where D is document size.

**Resource Utilization:**
*   **Memory:** High for AI/NLP Analysis Services (loading large models). Moderate for Document Ingestion, Elasticsearch.
*   **CPU:** Very High for AI/NLP Analysis (or GPU if accelerated). High for Document Ingestion, Search Service.
*   **I/O:** High for Object Storage (S3), Elasticsearch (indexing & queries), Event Bus.

**Scalability Assessment (NFR-Sc1, NFR-Sc2, NFR-P3):**
*   **Excellent Potential:** Due to Microservices architecture, Docker/Kubernetes, Event-Driven Asynchronous Processing, and choice of highly scalable technologies (Elasticsearch, PostgreSQL, AWS S3).
*   **Challenge:** Managing the cost of scaling computationally intensive AI services while meeting performance targets.

## Known Limitations

*   **AI Model Accuracy:** While continuously improved via user feedback and retraining, AI models may still exhibit inaccuracies, especially with highly specialized domain jargon or nuanced contexts (RT2).
*   **OCR Quality:** The accuracy of Optical Character Recognition for scanned documents can vary significantly with input image quality, impacting subsequent text extraction and AI analysis (AS3, RT1).
*   **Complexity of Distributed Systems:** The Microservices architecture introduces inherent operational complexity regarding debugging, distributed transactions, and ensuring eventual consistency.
*   **Data Volume for Training:** The effectiveness of AI model retraining (FR3.5) is dependent on the volume and quality of user feedback data collected.
*   **External Data Source Integration:** Phase 3's continuous monitoring feature (FR3.3) is subject to the availability, quality, and API limitations of external data providers.
*   **Ambition of NFR-P1:** Achieving "30 seconds for text extraction and basic AI analysis" for a 50-page document might be challenging for computationally heavy AI tasks like abstractive summarization without significant GPU acceleration and model optimization.

## Testing Instructions

The system employs a comprehensive testing strategy covering unit, integration, end-to-end, performance, and security testing.

### 1. Local Testing
*   **Unit Tests:** Each microservice has its own suite of unit tests.
    *   Navigate to a service's directory (e.g., `services/user-management-service`).
    *   Run tests: `pytest` (assuming pytest is installed and configured).
*   **Integration Tests:** Mock external dependencies where necessary, but focus on testing interactions between internal components of a single service or between tightly coupled services.
    *   Run tests: `pytest --integration` (or similar tag depending on setup).

### 2. Automated Testing (CI/CD)
All code changes pushed to feature branches and pull requests automatically trigger the CI/CD pipeline, which includes:
*   **Linting and Static Analysis:** Enforces coding standards (`coding_standards.docx`).
*   **Unit and Integration Tests:** Runs all automated tests for affected services.
*   **Container Image Vulnerability Scanning:** Scans Docker images for known vulnerabilities.
*   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Scans third-party libraries for security vulnerabilities.
*   **API Contract Testing:** Validates that API changes do not break contracts with other services.

### 3. Performance Testing
*   **Load and Stress Testing:** Tools like Locust, JMeter, or k6 are used to simulate user load and document volumes.
    *   **Phase 1 Focus:** Validate NFR-P1 (text extraction speed) and NFR-P2 (basic search response).
    *   **Phase 2 Focus:** Validate NFR-P1 (AI analysis speed) and NFR-P2 (AI insight search).
    *   **Phase 3 Focus:** Comprehensive testing to validate NFR-P3 (1 million documents/month) and complex report generation.
*   **Profiling:** Use Python profilers (e.g., `cProfile`, `py-spy`) and distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry/AWS X-Ray) to identify bottlenecks in computationally intensive services, especially AI/NLP components.

### 4. Security Testing
*   **Regular Security Audits & Penetration Testing:** Conducted by internal or third-party security teams.
*   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Continuous scanning of all deployed components (containers, cloud configurations) for vulnerabilities.
*   **RBAC Testing:** Rigorous testing of Role-Based Access Control policies to prevent unauthorized access and privilege escalation.
*   **Data Masking Validation:** Specific tests to ensure sensitive PII/PHI is correctly identified and masked/redacted before storage and AI analysis.
*   **AI Model Security Testing:** Testing for adversarial inputs and monitoring for model integrity and bias.

### 5. AI Model Specific Testing
*   **Accuracy Metrics:** Continuous evaluation of AI model performance using relevant metrics (e.g., F1-score for entity recognition, ROUGE for summarization).
*   **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Involving end-users to validate the relevance and utility of AI-generated insights.
*   **MLOps Pipeline Testing:** Automated tests for data pipelines, model training, and deployment processes to ensure reliability and reproducibility of AI model updates.

## Deployment Guide

The system is deployed using a CI/CD pipeline on AWS, leveraging Docker for containerization and Kubernetes (AWS EKS) for orchestration.

### 1. Prerequisites
*   An active AWS account with administrative access or appropriately scoped IAM roles.
*   An existing AWS EKS cluster configured.
*   AWS CLI configured with credentials.
*   `kubectl` and `helm` installed and configured to connect to your EKS cluster.
*   Docker Desktop installed.

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline
Our CI/CD pipeline (e.g., AWS CodePipeline/GitHub Actions) automates the following steps:
1.  **Source Stage:** Detects changes in the Git repository (`develop` branch for integration, `main` for production).
2.  **Build Stage:**
    *   Runs linters, static analysis, and unit tests.
    *   Builds Docker images for each microservice.
    *   Pushes Docker images to AWS ECR (Elastic Container Registry).
    *   Performs container image vulnerability scanning and SCA.
3.  **Test Stage:**
    *   Deploys services to a staging Kubernetes environment.
    *   Runs integration, end-to-end, and performance tests.
    *   Runs security tests (e.g., API security tests, RBAC validation).
4.  **Deployment Stage:**
    *   If all tests pass, the pipeline triggers a deployment to the target environment (e.g., production).
    *   Uses Helm charts to manage Kubernetes deployments, ensuring versioning and rollback capabilities.

### 3. Manual Deployment (for Development/Debugging)
While automated CI/CD is preferred, individual services can be deployed manually for local development or targeted debugging:

1.  **Build Docker Image:**
    ```bash
    cd services/your-service-name
    docker build -t your-service-name:latest .
    ```
2.  **Deploy to Kubernetes (using Helm):**
    Ensure your Helm chart (`charts/your-service-name`) is configured for local or development cluster deployment.
    ```bash
    helm upgrade --install your-service-name charts/your-service-name --set image.tag=latest
    ```
    *Note: Adjust Helm chart values for specific environments (e.g., database endpoints, AWS credentials if not using Secrets Manager).*

### 4. Configuration Management
*   **Environment Variables:** Used for runtime configuration, sensitive values managed by AWS Secrets Manager.
*   **Kubernetes ConfigMaps:** For non-sensitive configuration data that can be shared across pods.
*   **Helm Charts:** Parameterize deployments, allowing environment-specific configurations.

### 5. Monitoring and Logging
*   **Centralized Logging:** All microservices stream logs to AWS CloudWatch Logs or an ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized access and analysis (NFR-S4).
*   **Metrics:** Prometheus and Grafana are used to collect and visualize performance metrics (CPU, memory, network I/O, AI inference times) for all services.
*   **Distributed Tracing:** OpenTelemetry (or AWS X-Ray) is integrated to provide end-to-end visibility of requests across microservices for latency analysis and troubleshooting.

**Rationale:** Robust architecture designed for scalability. However, ambitious NFRs for AI/NLP processing speed and potential resource contention require continuous optimization and monitoring.

**Critical Performance Issues & Optimizations:**
1.  **Intense AI/NLP Workloads vs. NFR-P1 (30s document processing):**
    *   **Optimization:** Aggressive AI model optimization (quantization, knowledge distillation, ONNX/TensorRT) and **GPU acceleration** (Phase 2+). Smart batching for AI inference (Phase 2). Stratified AI processing where less critical analysis might run asynchronously.
2.  **Resource Contention during Peak Loads (NFR-P3: 1M documents/month):**
    *   **Optimization:** Continuous performance monitoring with distributed tracing (Phase 2+). Comprehensive load/stress testing (Phase 2+). Refined auto-scaling policies for microservices.
3.  **Python GIL for CPU-Bound Tasks:**
    *   **Mitigation:** Horizontal scaling of AI services (NFR-Sc1) and explicit GPU acceleration (Phase 2+) to maximize per-instance efficiency.

**Optimization Opportunities:**
*   **Targeted Caching:** Redis integration for document metadata, common search queries/results, and aggregated report data (Phase 2+).
*   **Database and Search Engine Tuning:** Continuous optimization of indexing strategies, query performance for Elasticsearch, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB (Phase 1+).
*   **Efficient Inter-Service Communication:** Optimize message sizes, serialization formats, and minimize synchronous calls.
*   **Document Pre-processing Efficiency:** Streamline text extraction and OCR in Document Ingestion Service.

**Algorithmic Analysis (General Complexity):**
*   **Text Extraction:** O(N) where N is document size. OCR adds significant variable overhead.
*   **AI/NLP Analysis:** Can range from O(L) to O(L^2) depending on model and input length (L). Summarization and Information Extraction are typically the most intensive.
*   **Search (Elasticsearch):** O(log N) or O(1) for indexed fields. Indexing is O(D) where D is document size.

**Resource Utilization:**
*   **Memory:** High for AI/NLP Analysis Services (loading large models). Moderate for Document Ingestion, Elasticsearch.
*   **CPU:** Very High for AI/NLP Analysis (or GPU if accelerated). High for Document Ingestion, Search Service.
*   **I/O:** High for Object Storage (S3), Elasticsearch (indexing & queries), Event Bus.

**Scalability Assessment (NFR-Sc1, NFR-Sc2, NFR-P3):**
*   **Excellent Potential:** Due to Microservices architecture, Docker/Kubernetes, Event-Driven Asynchronous Processing, and choice of highly scalable technologies (Elasticsearch, PostgreSQL, AWS S3).
*   **Challenge:** Managing the cost of scaling computationally intensive AI services while meeting performance targets.

## Known Limitations

*   **AI Model Accuracy:** While continuously improved via user feedback and retraining, AI models may still exhibit inaccuracies, especially with highly specialized domain jargon or nuanced contexts (RT2).
*   **OCR Quality:** The accuracy of Optical Character Recognition for scanned documents can vary significantly with input image quality, impacting subsequent text extraction and AI analysis (AS3, RT1).
*   **Complexity of Distributed Systems:** The Microservices architecture introduces inherent operational complexity regarding debugging, distributed transactions, and ensuring eventual consistency.
*   **Data Volume for Training:** The effectiveness of AI model retraining (FR3.5) is dependent on the volume and quality of user feedback data collected.
*   **External Data Source Integration:** Phase 3's continuous monitoring feature (FR3.3) is subject to the availability, quality, and API limitations of external data providers.
*   **Ambition of NFR-P1:** Achieving "30 seconds for text extraction and basic AI analysis" for a 50-page document might be challenging for computationally heavy AI tasks like abstractive summarization without significant GPU acceleration and model optimization.
