### Technical Constraints

*   **Technology stack preferences:**
    *   **TC1.1: Backend:** Python is the preferred language, leveraging frameworks like Flask or FastAPI for APIs.
    *   **TC1.2: AI/ML Libraries:** Utilize established Python libraries for NLP and ML (e.g., spaCy, Hugging Face Transformers, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch).
    *   **TC1.3: Document Processing:** Libraries for various document types (e.g., Apache Tika via `tika` Python wrapper, `PyPDF2`, `python-docx`, `openpyxl`).
    *   **TC1.4: Database:** A scalable database solution (e.g., PostgreSQL for relational data, Elasticsearch for text search/indexing).
    *   **TC1.5: Cloud Platform:** Preference for a major cloud provider (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure) for infrastructure, managed services, and scalability.
*   **Platform constraints:**
    *   **TC2.1: Web-based Application:** The primary interface shall be a web application, accessible via modern web browsers.
    *   **TC2.2: API-First Design:** The system should expose a robust API for potential future integrations and extensions.
*   **Integration requirements:**
    *   **TC3.1: External Data Sources:** Potential for integration with external news feeds, market databases, or social media platforms (future phase).
    *   **TC3.2: Version Control:** All code development shall adhere to Git-based version control practices (as per `coding_standards.docx`).

### Assumptions and Clarifications

*   **Assumptions Made:**
    *   **AS1: Target Audience:** The tool is primarily for business analysts, market researchers, and decision-makers who need to extract insights from large volumes of documents.
    *   **AS2: Data Volume Growth:** There will be a continuous growth in the volume of documents to be processed.
    *   **AS3: Document Quality:** Input documents are generally readable, though some OCR for scanned documents might be required.
    *   **AS4: AI Model Availability:** Pre-trained AI models for common NLP tasks will be utilized where possible, with fine-tuning as needed.
*   **Questions that need clarification:**
    *   **Q1: Specific Document Types:** Are there any proprietary or highly specialized document formats that need to be supported beyond common ones?
    *   **Q2: Specific AI Capabilities:** Which specific AI-powered insights are most critical for the initial release (e.g., sentiment, entity, summarization)?

### Risk Assessment

*   **Potential Technical Risks:**
    *   **RT1: Data Quality & Variability:** Documents can vary widely in quality, structure, and language, impacting text extraction accuracy and AI model performance.
        *   **Mitigation:** Implement robust pre-processing pipelines (e.g., OCR, noise reduction). Continuously monitor AI model performance and implement feedback loops for improvement.
    *   **RT2: AI Model Accuracy & Bias:** Generic AI models may not perform optimally for specific industry jargon or nuanced contexts, potentially introducing bias or inaccuracies.
        *   **Mitigation:** Utilize domain-specific fine-tuning of models. Implement mechanisms for user feedback and model retraining. Conduct regular audits of model output for bias.
    *   **RT3: Scalability Challenges:** Handling very large volumes of documents and concurrent users without performance degradation.
        *   **Mitigation:** Design with a microservices architecture, leverage cloud-native services for auto-scaling, implement efficient data indexing (e.g., Elasticsearch).
    *   **RT4: Data Security & Privacy Breaches:** Sensitive information within documents could be exposed if security measures are inadequate.
        *   **Mitigation:** Adhere strictly to industry security standards (e.g., ISO 27001, GDPR compliance if applicable). Implement end-to-end encryption, regular security audits, and access controls.
    *   **RT5: Integration Complexity:** Integrating with diverse external data sources or existing enterprise systems can be complex and time-consuming.
        *   **Mitigation:** Standardize API interfaces. Prioritize integrations based on business value. Use robust error handling and monitoring for integrations.
*   **Mitigation strategies:**
    *   Adopt a phased approach (as outlined in functional requirements) to validate core functionalities before adding advanced features.
    *   Implement continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines for rapid iteration and deployment.
    *   Conduct thorough testing, including unit, integration, and user acceptance testing, particularly for AI model outputs.
    *   Establish clear documentation standards for code, APIs, and system architecture (aligned with `coding_standards.docx`).
    *   Regularly review and update the technology stack to leverage advancements in AI and cloud computing.
