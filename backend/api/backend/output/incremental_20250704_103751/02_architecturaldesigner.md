The system will adopt a **Microservices Architecture** orchestrated around an **Event-Driven Architecture**. This approach is chosen to meet the requirements for high scalability, performance, resilience, and maintainability, allowing independent development and deployment of features. An **API Gateway** will serve as the single entry point for client applications.

**Overall System Design and Components:**

*   **Client Applications:** Web-based User Interface (UI).
*   **API Gateway:** Routes external requests to appropriate microservices, handles authentication and initial authorization.
*   **Core Microservices:**
    *   **User Management Service:** Manages user accounts, authentication, and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
    *   **Document Management Service:** Handles document uploads, storage (object storage), metadata management, and lifecycle.
    *   **Document Ingestion Service:** Extracts raw text from various document formats, performs OCR if necessary, and preprocesses content.
    *   **AI/NLP Analysis Services (Collection of specialized services):**
        *   **Entity Recognition Service**
        *   **Keyword Extraction Service**
        *   **Document Summarization Service**
        *   **Document Classification Service**
        *   **Sentiment Analysis Service**
        *   **Information Extraction Service** (for structured/semi-structured data)
    *   **Search Service:** Indexes document content and analysis results, providing powerful search capabilities.
    *   **Reporting Service:** Aggregates analyzed data to generate custom reports.
    *   **Notification Service:** Manages system notifications (e.g., processing complete, errors).
*   **Shared Infrastructure:**
    *   **Event Bus/Message Broker:** Facilitates asynchronous communication and decoupling between microservices.
    *   **Databases:**
        *   **Relational Database:** For user data, document metadata, and critical system configuration.
        *   **NoSQL Database:** For storing flexible AI analysis results.
        *   **Search Engine Database:** For full-text search indexing.

### Design Patterns

**Architectural Patterns:**

*   **Microservices Architecture:** Decomposes the application into loosely coupled, independently deployable services, enabling scalability (NFR-Sc1, NFR-Sc2), resilience, and maintainability.
*   **Event-Driven Architecture:** Decouples services through asynchronous communication via an Event Bus, improving scalability, responsiveness, and flexibility. Crucial for asynchronous document processing (NFR-P1).
*   **API Gateway Pattern:** Provides a unified, secure entry point for external clients, abstracting internal microservice complexity.
*   **Layered Architecture (within each Microservice):** Follows Clean Architecture principles with Presentation, Application, Domain, and Infrastructure layers, ensuring separation of concerns, testability, and maintainability (SOLID principles).
*   **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):** Potentially considered for the Reporting Service to optimize read-heavy operations, separating the data model for queries from the data model for updates.

**Design Patterns for Implementation:**

*   **Repository Pattern:** Abstracts data access logic, making services independent of specific database technologies and improving testability.
*   **Factory Pattern:** Used for creating instances of document parsers (e.g., PDF parser, DOCX parser) or specific AI models based on input type.
*   **Strategy Pattern:** Encapsulates different AI analysis algorithms (e.g., different summarization techniques, classification models) allowing them to be interchangeable.
*   **Circuit Breaker Pattern:** Enhances resilience in inter-service communication by preventing cascading failures when a downstream service is unavailable.
*   **Observer Pattern:** Naturally implemented through the Event Bus, where services "observe" and react to relevant events.
*   **Domain-Driven Design (DDD):** Applied to define clear boundaries and responsibilities for each microservice based on the business domain (e.g., Document, User, Analysis).

### Quality Attributes

**Scalability (NFR-Sc1, NFR-Sc2, NFR-P3):**
*   **Microservices:** Each service can be scaled independently based on demand, allowing for efficient resource utilization. For instance, `Document Ingestion Service` can scale up during peak upload times, while `AI/NLP Analysis Services` can scale based on processing backlog.
*   **Asynchronous Processing:** Document processing is entirely asynchronous via the `Event Bus`. This prevents blocking and allows for high throughput, meeting NFR-P1 for concurrent processing and NFR-P3 for overall volume.
*   **Cloud-Native Services:** Leveraging AWS managed services (EKS for container orchestration, S3 for storage, RDS for databases, SQS/SNS/Kafka for messaging) inherently provides auto-scaling, elasticity, and load balancing capabilities.
*   **Elasticsearch:** Designed for horizontal scaling to handle large volumes of indexed data and high query loads, directly addressing NFR-P2.

**Security (NFR-S1, NFR-S2, NFR-S3, NFR-S4):**
*   **Data Encryption:** All uploaded documents and extracted data will be encrypted at rest (AWS S3 SSE, database encryption) and in transit (TLS/SSL for all API endpoints and inter-service communication) (NFR-S1).
*   **Authentication & Authorization:** API Gateway handles secure user authentication (NFR-S3) using OAuth 2.0/JWT. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) (NFR-S2) is enforced by the User Management Service and validated by downstream services.
*   **Least Privilege:** All microservices and users will operate with the minimum necessary permissions.
*   **Audit Trails:** Comprehensive logging of all user actions and system operations (NFR-S4) will be captured via centralized logging (e.g., CloudWatch, ELK stack) for security auditing.
*   **Vulnerability Management:** Regular security audits, penetration testing, and adherence to industry best practices (e.g., OWASP Top 10).

**Performance (NFR-P1, NFR-P2):**
*   **Asynchronous Processing:** Documents are processed in the background, ensuring the UI remains responsive and the system can handle concurrent uploads without degradation. This directly supports NFR-P1.
*   **Optimized Data Access:** Elasticsearch provides sub-second search response times (NFR-P2) even for large datasets. Relational and NoSQL databases are chosen for their performance characteristics in their respective use cases.
*   **FastAPI Backend:** FastAPI is known for its high performance due to its asynchronous nature and underlying Starlette/Uvicorn components.
*   **AI Model Optimization:** Utilize optimized versions of AI models (e.g., ONNX, quantized models) and potentially GPU acceleration for inference to improve processing speed (NFR-P1).
*   **Caching:** Implement caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed metadata or aggregated data where appropriate to reduce database load.

**Maintainability (SOLID principles, Clean Architecture):**
*   **Microservices:** Smaller, focused codebases are easier to understand, debug, and maintain. Independent deployments reduce the risk of regressions across the entire system.
*   **Clean Architecture/Layered Design:** Within each microservice, strict separation of concerns between domain logic, application logic, and infrastructure details ensures modularity, testability, and adaptability to changes.
*   **API-First Design:** Clearly defined API contracts (using OpenAPI/Swagger) for all services facilitate independent development and reduce integration issues.
*   **Standardized Technologies:** Utilizing widely adopted technologies (Python, React, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes) ensures access to a large talent pool and established best practices.
*   **Automated Testing & CI/CD:** Comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests, combined with CI/CD pipelines, enable rapid and reliable deployments, reducing manual errors and increasing confidence in changes.
*   **Centralized Logging and Monitoring:** Provides clear visibility into system health, performance metrics, and error rates, simplifying troubleshooting and proactive maintenance.
